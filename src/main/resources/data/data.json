{"Alcohol poisoning":{"Introduction":{" ":"Alcohol poisoning occurs when a person drinks a toxic amount of alcohol, usually over a short period of time (binge drinking). Being poisoned by alcohol can damage your health or even put your life in danger. It's important to avoid misusing alcohol and to be aware of how much you're drinking and the effect this could have on your body. This topic covers: Signs and symptoms When to seek medical help Treatment in hospital Dangers of alcohol poisoning How alcohol poisoning occurs The effects of alcohol Recommended alcohol limits The signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning include: confusion severely slurred speech loss of co-ordination vomiting irregular or slow breathing hypothermia (pale or blue-tinged skin caused by low body temperature) stupor (being conscious but unresponsive) passing out and being unconscious In the most severe cases, alcohol poisoning can lead to coma, brain damage and death. If you suspect alcohol poisoning, dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance. While you're waiting: try to keep them sitting up and awake give them water if they can drink it if they've passed out, lie them on their side in the recovery position and check they're breathing properly keep them warm stay with them and monitor their symptoms Never leave a person alone to 'sleep it off'. The level of alcohol in a person's blood can continue to rise for up to 30-40 minutes after their last drink. This can cause their symptoms to suddenly become much more severe. You also shouldn't give them coffee or any more alcohol, put them under a cold shower or walk them around. These won't help someone 'sober up' and may even be dangerous. In hospital, the person will be carefully monitored until the alcohol has left their system. If treatment is required, this may include: inserting a tube into their mouth and windpipe (intubation) \u2013 to open the airway, remove any blockages and help with breathing fitting an intravenous drip, which goes directly into a vein \u2013 to top up their water, blood sugar and vitamin levels fitting a catheter (thin tube) to their bladder \u2013 to drain urine straight into a bag so they don't wet themselves If a person is poisoned by alcohol they could: choke on their vomit stop breathing have a heart attack inhale vomit, leading to fatal lung damage become severely dehydrated, which can cause permanent brain damage in extreme cases develop more severe hypothermia have seizures (fits) as a result of lowered blood sugar levels Repeated vomiting and retching can lead to the vomiting of blood as a result of a torn blood vessel (Mallory-Weiss tear) at the junction of the stomach and gullet. ","Around 10-12 units":"your co-ordination will be seriously impaired, placing you at high risk of having an accident you may stagger around or feel unstable on your feet you'll feel drowsy or dizzy the amount of alcohol in your body will begin to reach toxic (poisonous) levels you may need to go to the toilet more often as your body attempts to quickly pass the alcohol out of your body in your urine you'll be dehydrated in the morning, and probably have a severe headache the excess alcohol in your system may upset your digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or indigestion ","More than 12 units":"you're at high risk of developing alcohol poisoning, particularly if you're drinking lots of units in a short space of time the alcohol can begin to interfere with the automatic functions of your body, such as your breathing, heart rate and gag reflex you're at risk of losing consciousness If you drink most weeks, to reduce your risk of harming your health: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week One unit of alcohol is equivalent to: half a pint of lower-strength lager, beer or cider (ABV 3.6%) a single small shot of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%) Read more about alcohol units.

For example, they may: have an accident or get injured become involved in violent or antisocial behaviour have unsafe sex, which can lead to an unplanned pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) lose personal possessions Every time you drink alcohol, your liver has to filter it out of your blood. Alcohol is absorbed quickly into your body (much quicker than food), but the body can only process around one unit of alcohol an hour. If you drink a lot of alcohol over a short space of time, such as on a night out, your body won't have time to process it all. Alcohol poisoning can also occur if a person drinks household products that contain alcohol \u2013 children sometimes drink these by accident. The amount of alcohol in your bloodstream \u2013 known as your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) \u2013 will rise.

A duty holder is someone who is responsible for maintaining and repairing non-domestic premises. If any asbestos-containing materials in your workplace are assessed as being in good condition, and not in a position where they are likely to be damaged, they will usually be left in place and monitored. However, asbestos-containing materials that are in a poor condition or are likely to be damaged during the normal use of the building should be sealed, enclosed or removed as appropriate. ","Preventing asbestosis ":"Although asbestos is no longer widely used in the UK, it's still important to take precautions to reduce your risk of exposure, because it's still found in many old buildings. Strict regulations were introduced in 1970 to regulate the use of asbestos in the workplace. However, the import, supply and use of brown (amosite) and blue (crocidolite) asbestos was not banned in the UK until 1985. White asbestos (chrysotile) was banned in 1999, except for a small number of specialist uses of the material. This means that buildings that were built or refurbished before the year 2000 could still contain asbestos. ","Working with asbestos":"If your job means that you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure the appropriate precautions are taken before and during any work you do. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has drawn up the following checklist for employers, managers and traders to go through before carrying out work on a building that may contain asbestos: Steps that may help reduce your exposure to asbestos during your work include wearing protective equipment (such as a suitable face mask), cleaning up as you go (using a vacuum cleaner or wet rags, rather than sweeping) and not using power tools whenever possible. The HSE website has more information about: managing and working with asbestos dos and don'ts when working with asbestos task sheets outlining how to carry out non-licensed work with asbestos You may also find it useful to read the Control of Asbestos Regulations (2012), which outline the measures that should be in place to reduce the risk of asbestos exposure. Read the full Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (PDF, 143kb).

In these circumstances, it may be best to leave any asbestos-containing materials where they are \u2013 especially if they are in good condition and unlikely to get damaged. You should check the condition of the materials from time to time to make sure they haven't been damaged or started to deteriorate. Slightly damaged asbestos-containing materials can sometimes be repaired by sealing or enclosing them. However, this should only be done by someone with the necessary training. Any badly-damaged asbestos material that cannot be protected should be removed by someone who is appropriately trained. Your local environmental health officer can advise you about this. If you are planning any home improvements, repairs or maintenance, and you intend to bring in any additional workers or contractors, you should inform them of any asbestos materials in your home before they start work. This will help reduce the risks of any asbestos-containing material being disturbed. You can search for who to contact about asbestos in your home on the GOV.UK website. ","URL":"/conditions/Asbestosis"},"Treatment":{"Treating asbestosis ":"There is no cure for asbestosis, as the damage to the lungs is irreversible. However, you can take steps to reduce your symptoms and improve your quality of life. These are outlined below. ","Not smoking":"If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, it's very important to stop as soon as possible. Smoking can make your symptoms of breathlessness worse and significantly increase your risk of developing lung cancer at a later stage. Speak to your GP for help with giving up smoking. They can advise about nicotine replacement therapies and prescription medicines that can greatly increase your chances of quitting successfully. Your GP can also put you in touch with local support groups in your area. You can also call the NHS Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking. Read more about stopping smoking. ","Medication":"Most people with asbestosis will not benefit from any specific medication for the condition, unless you have another condition also affecting the lungs, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). More severe cases may benefit from medicines, such as small doses of morphine to reduce breathlessness and a cough. Serious side effects are uncommon, because the dose is so small. The most common problem is constipation, and a laxative will usually be given at the same time to help you pass stools. Page last reviewed: 22/09/2014 Next review due: 22/07/2017 ","Vaccinations":"If you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection. It's recommended that you have the influenza (flu) vaccination to protect against flu, and the pneumococcal vaccination to protect you from the bacteria that can cause serious conditions, such as pneumonia. Your GP can arrange for you to have these vaccinations. You will need the flu vaccine every year to ensure you stay protected. Most people only require one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, although additional booster shots may be recommended if your general health is poor. ","URL":"/conditions/Asbestosis","Long-term oxygen therapy":"If you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting all the oxygen it needs to function properly. Oxygen therapy may be recommended if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy is supplied through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, which purifies oxygen from the air in the room and produces a more oxygen-rich supply of air. This oxygen-rich air is breathed in through a mask or a small, soft plastic tube placed just inside your nostrils (nasal cannula). You may be given a small, portable oxygen tank and mask, to be used when you're out of the house. This is known as ambulatory oxygen. It's very important not to smoke when you are using an oxygen concentrator. This is because high concentrations of oxygen are highly flammable, and a lit cigarette or flame could cause a fire or an explosion. "},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction. Asbestos can be very dangerous. It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres. When the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary. However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure. Read more about the causes of asbestosis. ","Outlook":"The outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present. Asbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person's health and shorten their life expectancy, but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all. However, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: pleural disease \u2013 where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort mesothelioma \u2013 a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut lung cancer Overall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself. ","Compensation":"If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through: industrial injuries disablement benefit \u2013 this is a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed) a civil claim for compensation through the courts \u2013 you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this a claim for a lump compensation sum under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 \u2013 if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading Read more about industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website. ","Symptoms of asbestosis":"Breathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including: shortness of breath \u2013 this may only occur after physical activity at first, but it can eventually become a more constant problem a persistent cough wheezing fatigue (extreme tiredness) chest pain in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips Nowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace. See your GP if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past. Read more about diagnosing asbestosis. ","Who is affected":"Asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years. However, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012. Page last reviewed: 22/09/2014 Next review due: 22/07/2017 ","Treating asbestosis":"There is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs. One of the most important things someone with the condition can do is to stop smoking, if they smoke. This is because the symptoms are more likely to get worse in people who smoke, and smoking also increases the risk of lung cancer in people with asbestosis. If necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis. Read more about treating asbestosis. ","URL":"/conditions/Asbestosis","Preventing asbestosis":"There are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these \u2013 called crocidolite and amosite \u2013 were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999. However, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings. It's therefore important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos. If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself. If your job means you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely. Read about preventing asbestosis. "},"Causes":{"Causes of asbestosis ":"Asbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibres. People working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past. ","What is asbestos?":"Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. Materials containing asbestos used to be widely used in construction, because they are strong, durable and fire-resistant. There were three main types of asbestos in commercial use: crocidolite (\"blue asbestos\") amosite (\"brown asbestos\") chrysotile (\"white asbestos\") All these types of asbestos are hazardous if a material containing them becomes damaged and the fibres are released into the air. No crocidolite was imported into the UK after 1970, and both amosite and crocidolite were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans on the industrial use of both these materials came into force earlier than this). Chrysotile was not banned until 1999. This means that, although asbestos is no longer used, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. ","How asbestos fibres affect the lungs":"When you inhale a foreign body, such as a dust particle, cells in the lungs called macrophages usually hunt and break the particle down before it gets into your lung tissues and bloodstream. However, asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down. In an attempt to break down the fibres, the macrophages release substances that are intended to destroy the fibres, but actually cause the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) to become damaged and permanently scarred over time. This scarring is what is known as asbestosis. Alveoli are crucial in transferring oxygen from the air into your bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. If they become damaged and scarred, these processes will be affected, resulting in symptoms such as breathlessness. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure \u2013 usually over many years \u2013 to relatively high numbers of asbestosis fibres is necessary. ","URL":"/conditions/Asbestosis","Occupations associated with asbestos exposure":"The use of asbestos increased significantly after World War II. It peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, where asbestos was used during this time period. Occupations particularly associated with exposure to asbestos during this period include: insulation workers boilermakers plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters shipyard workers sheet metal workers plasterers chemical technicians  heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics Now that asbestos is no longer used, those most at risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres include people whose jobs put them at risk of damaging any asbestos remaining in older buildings, such as caretakers, electricians and demolition workers. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website has more information about when you are most likely to be at risk of asbestos exposure. Page last reviewed: 22/09/2014 Next review due: 22/07/2017 "},"Title":"Asbestosis","Diagnosis":{"Diagnosing asbestosis ":"When diagnosing asbestosis, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs). If your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they will usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in. Your GP will also ask about your work history, particularly about periods when you may have been exposed to asbestos, how long you may have been exposed, and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working. ","Referral to a specialist":"If asbestosis is suspected, you will be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. These may include:  a chest X-ray \u2013 to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs that could be caused by asbestosis a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the lungs \u2013 which produces more detailed images of the lungs and the membrane covering the lungs and can help identify less obvious abnormalities lung function tests \u2013 to assess the impact of damage of the lungs, determine how much air your lungs can hold and assess how well oxygen crosses the membrane of the lungs into your bloodstream Before confirming a diagnosis of asbestosis, the chest specialist will also consider and rule out other possible causes of lung inflammation and scarring, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

It results in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body. This can turn urine and parts of the body a dark colour and lead to a range of problems over time. Normally, amino acids are broken down in a series of chemical reactions. But in alkaptonuria, a substance produced along the way \u2013 homogentisic acid \u2013 cannot be broken down any further. This is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down doesn't work properly (enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen). One of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours. If this sign is missed or overlooked, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s. ","Outlook":"People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they will usually experience severe symptoms, such as pain and loss of movement in the joints, which considerably impact on quality of life. Working and carrying out strenuous physical activity will usually become very difficult, and eventually you may need mobility aids such as a wheelchair to get around. Visit the AKU Society website for more information and support. ","How alkaptonuria is inherited":"Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents. One of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell. The gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the disease is very rare \u2013 affecting just 1 in 250,000 to 500,000 people worldwide, and only around 64 people in total in the UK. The parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they won't have any signs or symptoms of the condition. ","How alkaptonuria is managed":"Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition \u2013 there's currently no specific treatment or cure. However, a medicine called nitisinone has shown some promise, and painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms. Nitisinone is not licensed for alkaptonuria \u2013 it's offered \"off label\" at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Nitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. It's currently an experimental treatment, but research into its effectiveness is ongoing and there have been some promising results so far. The AKU Society has information on DevelopAKUre, a clinical trial programme for nitisinone. Register your interest for DevelopAKUre. If the condition is diagnosed in childhood, it may be possible to slow its progression by restricting protein in the diet, as this may reduce levels of tyrosine and phenylalanine in your body. A low-protein diet can also be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects of nitisinone during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian can advise you about this. If alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints. Exercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms. The AKU Society recommends avoiding exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby, and trying gentle exercise such as yoga, swimming and pilates instead. Your GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan as there's a risk the wrong sort of exercise may damage your joints. Speak to doctor about painkillers and other techniques to manage pain. You may want to try transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), where a machine is used to numb the nerve endings in your spinal cord and reduce pain. This treatment is usually arranged by a physiotherapist. Read about living with pain. A diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Like many people with a long-term health condition, those who find out they have alkaptonuria may feel anxious or depressed. But there are people you can talk to who can help. Talk to your GP if you feel you need support to cope with your illness. You could also visit the AKU Society website, a charity offering support to patients, their families and carers. Sometimes surgery may be necessary if joints are damaged and need replacing, or if heart valves or vessels have hardened. Read about some common procedures: hip replacement knee replacement  aortic valve replacement ","Signs and symptoms in adults":"Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body. It can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems. When a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 20s or 30s, they may start to experience joint problems. Typically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are the early symptoms of osteoarthritis.  Eventually, cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body) may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations are often needed. An obvious sign of alkaptonuria in adults is thickening and blue-black discolouration of ear cartilage. This is known as ochronosis. The earwax may also be black or reddish-brown. Many people develop brown or grey spots on the whites of their eyes as well. Alkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish colour. The skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found \u2013 the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area. If the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Deposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken. This can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements. The deposits can also lead to kidney stones, bladder stones and prostate stones. ","Information about you":"If you or your child has alkaptonuria, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It's also known as infectious or bacterial arthritis. Any joint can be affected by septic arthritis, but it's most common in the knees and hips. More than one joint can be affected at the same time. Most people make a full recovery after treatment. Without treatment, septic arthritis may lead to permanent joint damage and can become life threatening. Septic arthritis typically causes severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. These symptoms tend to develop quickly over a few hours or days. You may also have difficulty moving the affected joint, and some people have a high temperature (fever). Young children with septic arthritis will generally be irritable and may cry whenever the infected joint is moved \u2013 for example, during nappy changing. They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on affected joints. If you suspect septic arthritis, see your GP or visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. If your symptoms suggest septic arthritis, your GP will refer you to your nearest A&E department immediately for an assessment. You may have a blood test and a sample of fluid may be removed from your affected joint with a needle. This is to look for signs of inflammation and infection, and to identify any bacteria. If you have septic arthritis, there may be high numbers of white blood cells in your blood and joint fluid, which is a sign of infection. However, these tests come back normal in many cases of septic arthritis, so they can't be relied on entirely to rule out infection. Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics. You'll normally need to stay in hospital for at least two weeks to have antibiotics given to you directly into a vein (intravenously). You may need to rest in bed for a few days to take pressure off the affected joint. You'll be given medication to relieve the pain. You might also have the fluid drained from your infected joint using a needle and syringe, or during a procedure called an arthroscopy. This is where a fine, metal tube is inserted through a small cut made near the affected joint. This will normally be done by an orthopaedic surgeon. After you finish the course of intravenous antibiotics, you'll probably need to take antibiotic tablets at home for at least another four weeks. You should completely recover after antibiotic treatment, although some people still experience persistent limited movement in the affected joint. The condition is most commonly caused by either: staphylococcal bacteria streptococcal bacteria These bacteria may enter a wound and travel through your bloodstream to the affected joint, or may infect your joint directly after an injury or during surgery. The following things can increase your risk of septic arthritis: having joint surgery, such as a knee replacement or hip replacement having a bacterial infection somewhere else in your body having a long-term condition such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis using injected drugs taking medication that suppresses your immune system recently injuring a joint Page last reviewed: 04/11/2016 Next review due: 04/11/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/septic-arthritis"},"Title":"Septic arthritis"},"Athlete's foot":{"Introduction":{" ":"Athlete's foot is a rash caused by a fungus that usually appears between the toes. The affected skin may be itchy, red, scaly, dry, cracked or blistered. It's not usually serious, but should be treated to stop it spreading to other parts of the body or other people. Treatment usually involves pharmacy-bought creams, sprays or liquids and good foot hygiene. The medical name for athlete's foot is tinea pedis. Athlete's foot most commonly affects the skin between the toes or on the bottom of the feet. Affected areas of skin may be: dry, red, scaly and flaky white, soggy and cracked itchy sore covered in small blisters The infection can spread around your foot and to your toenails \u2013 read more about fungal nail infections. Scratching the infected skin and then touching other parts of your body can also spread the infection. In severe cases, skin damaged by athlete's foot can become infected with bacteria. This can lead to cellulitis, which causes the skin to become red, hot and swollen. Athlete's foot is caused by fungi growing and multiplying on the skin. The fungi that cause the infection thrive in warm, dark and moist places like feet. You're more likely to get athlete's foot if you: don't keep your feet clean and dry wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, such as communal showers, locker rooms and gyms share towels, socks and shoes with other people have a weakened immune system have certain other health conditions, such as diabetes Athlete's foot can easily spread to other people by touching infected skin or coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Athlete's foot is unlikely to get better on its own. It can usually be treated using antifungal treatments available from pharmacies without needing to see a GP. Antifungal treatments work by stopping the fungus causing your athlete's foot from growing. They come in creams, sprays, liquids and powders, and are used in the following way: treatment should be applied directly to the affected skin and surrounding area wash and dry the affected skin before applying the treatment, and clean your hands afterwards continue treatment after the rash has cleared, as described in the leaflet that comes with your medicine, to make sure all the fungus has gone Antifungal treatments are similarly effective, although some work faster than others. A pharmacist can recommend an antifungal medicine that's safe for you to use. Not all types are suitable for children, older people, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. If your rash is very sore and itchy, a pharmacist may recommend using a mild steroid cream to ease any discomfort, but this should only be used for a short period and in combination with antifungal treatment. Contact your GP if your athlete's foot doesn't start to improve after a week of treatment, or if it's causing significant pain or discomfort. Your GP may take a small skin sample for testing and recommend stronger antifungal medicines, including tablets. It's also important to practise good foot hygiene during treatment to speed up recovery and prevent athlete's foot returning. You can reduce your risk of developing athlete's foot by: drying your feet gently but thoroughly after washing them, particularly the areas between your toes wearing cotton socks and roomy shoes made of natural materials such as leather \u2013 this can allow your feet to \"breathe\" wear a fresh pair of socks, tights or stockings every day change your shoes every couple of days \u2013 this allows them to dry out between uses not walking around barefoot in public showers and locker rooms not sharing towels, socks and shoes with other people, and ensuring your towels are washed regularly  using talcum powder on your feet to stop them getting sweaty not using moisturiser between your toes, as this can help fungi multiply If you or your child develops athlete's foot, there's no need to stay off work or school. Follow the advice above to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.

But if your child's anxiety is starting to affect their wellbeing, they may need some help to overcome it. What makes children anxious? When is anxiety a problem for children? What are the signs of anxiety in children? Why is my child anxious? How to help your anxious child Other ways to ease anxiety in children When should we get help? Children tend to feel anxious about different things at different ages. Many of these worries are a normal part of growing up. From about eight months to three years, for example, it's very common for young children to have something called separation anxiety. They may become clingy and cry when separated from their parents or carers. This is a normal stage in children's development and tends to ease off at around age two to three. It's also common for pre-school children to develop specific fears or phobias. Common fears in early childhood include animals, insects, storms, heights, water, blood, and the dark. These fears usually go away gradually on their own. Throughout a child's life there will be other times when they feel anxiety. Lots of children feel anxious when going to a new school, for example, or before tests and exams. Some children feel shy in social situations and may need support with this. Anxiety becomes a problem for children when it starts to get in the way of their day-to-day life. \"We all get anxious at times, but some children seem to live a life of anxiety, where it's not short-term and it's not just an occasional thing,\" says Paul Stallard, Professor of Child and Family Mental Health at the University of Bath. \"For example, if you go into any school at exam time all the kids will be anxious but some may be so anxious that they don't get into school that morning,\" says Professor Stallard. Severe anxiety like this can harm children's mental and emotional wellbeing, affecting their self-esteem and confidence. They may become withdrawn and go to great lengths to avoid things or situations that make them feel anxious. When young children feel anxious, they cannot always understand or express what they are feeling. You may notice that they: become irritable, tearful or clingy have difficulty sleeping wake in the night start wetting the bed have bad dreams In older children you may notice that they: lack the confidence to try new things or seem unable to face simple, everyday challenges find it hard to concentrate have problems with sleeping or eating are prone to angry outbursts have negative thoughts going round and round their head, or keep thinking that bad things are going to happen start avoiding everyday activities, such as seeing friends, going out in public or attending school See more about the physical symptoms of anxiety. Some children are more prone to worries and anxiety than others. Children often find change difficult and may become anxious following a house move or when starting a new school. Children who have had a distressing or traumatic experience, such as a car accident or house fire, may suffer with anxiety afterwards. Family arguments and conflict can also leave children feeling insecure and anxious. Teenagers are more likely to suffer with social anxiety than other age groups, avoiding social gatherings or making excuses to get out of them. Read more about social anxiety.

The aim of a post-mortem is to determine the cause of death. Post-mortems are carried out by pathologists (doctors who specialise in understanding the nature and causes of disease). The Royal College of Pathologists and the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) set the standards pathologists work to. Post-mortems provide useful information about how, when and why someone died, and they enable pathologists to obtain a better understanding of how diseases spread. Learning more about illnesses and medical conditions benefits patients too, because it means they'll receive more effective treatment in the future. If your child, partner or relative has died and a post-mortem is to be carried out, hospital bereavement officers can offer you support and advice. They also act as the main point of contact between you and the staff carrying out the post-mortem. ","The Human Tissue Authority":"The Human Tissue Authority (HTA) ensures that human tissue is used safely, ethically and with proper consent. It regulates organisations that remove, store and use tissue for research, medical treatment, post-mortem examination, teaching and public display. All premises where post-mortems are carried out must be licensed by the HTA. ","Bereavement support":"For many people, understanding the reason for a loved one's death helps them come to terms with their loss. Talking and sharing your feelings with someone can also help. Some people find that relying on the support of family and friends is the best way to cope. Your GP will be able to put you in touch with bereavement services in your area. You can also contact the national Cruse helpline on 0844 477 9400 or a local Cruse centre. Read more about bereavement and coming to terms with the death of a loved one. Page last reviewed: 25/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","When post-mortems are carried out":"A post-mortem examination will be carried out if it's been requested by: a coroner \u2013 because the cause of death is unknown, or following a sudden, violent or unexpected death a hospital doctor \u2013 to find out more about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research and understanding The two different types of post-mortem are discussed below. A coroner is a judicial officer responsible for investigating deaths in certain situations (see below). Coroners are usually lawyers or doctors with a minimum of five years' experience. In most cases, a doctor or the police refer a death to the coroner. A death will be referred to the coroner if: it's unexpected, such as the sudden death of a baby (cot death) it's violent, unnatural or suspicious, such as a suicide or drug overdose it's the result of an accident or injury it occurred during or soon after a hospital procedure, such as surgery the cause of death is unknown The main aim of a post-mortem requested by a coroner is to find out how someone died and decide whether an inquest is needed. An inquest is a legal investigation into the circumstances surrounding a person's death. If someone related to you has died and their death has been referred to a coroner, you won't be asked to give consent (permission) for a post-mortem to take place. This is because the coroner is required by law to carry out a post-mortem when a death is suspicious, sudden or unnatural. A coroner may decide to hold an inquest after a post-mortem has been completed. Samples of organs and tissues may need to be retained until after the inquest has finished. If the death occurred in suspicious circumstances, samples may also need to be kept by the police, as evidence, for a longer period. In some cases, samples may need to be kept for a number of months or even years. The coroner's office will discuss the situation with you if, following an inquest, tissue samples need to be retained for a certain length of time. Post-mortems are sometimes requested by hospital doctors to provide more information about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research. Sometimes, the partner or relative of the deceased person will request a hospital post-mortem to find out more about the cause of death. Hospital post-mortems can only be carried out with consent. Sometimes, a person may have given their consent before they died. If this isn't the case, a person who is close to the deceased can give their consent for a post-mortem to take place. Hospital post-mortems may be limited to particular areas of the body, such as the head, chest or abdomen. When you're asked to give your consent, this will be discussed with you. During the post-mortem, only the organs or tissue that you've agreed to can be removed for examination. The HTA recommends that you should be given at least 24 hours to consider your decision about the post-mortem examination. You should also be given the details of someone to contact in case you change your mind. ","What happens after a post-mortem":"After a post-mortem, the pathologist writes a report of the findings. If the post-mortem was requested by the coroner, the coroner or coroner's officer will let you know the cause of death determined by the pathologist. If you want a full copy of the pathologist's report, you can request this from the coroner's office, but there may be a fee. In some cases, the report may be sent to a hospital doctor or GP so they can discuss it with you. If the post-mortem was requested by a hospital doctor, you'll have to request the results from the hospital where the post-mortem took place. You may be charged a small fee for this. You can arrange to discuss the results with the doctor in charge of the deceased person's care while they were in hospital (if applicable), or with your GP. The HTA has produced a leaflet providing further information about what happens before, during and after the examination \u2013 Post-mortem examination: Your choices about organs and tissue (PDF, 68kb). ","URL":"/conditions/Post-mortem","What happens during a post-mortem":"A post-mortem will be carried out as soon as possible, usually within two to three working days of a person's death. In some cases, it may be possible for it to take place within 24 hours. Depending upon when the examination is due to take place, you may be able to see the body before the post-mortem is carried out. The post-mortem takes place in an examination room that looks similar to an operating theatre. The examination room will be licensed and inspected by the HTA. During the procedure, the deceased person's body is opened and the organs removed for examination. A diagnosis can sometimes be made by looking at the organs. Some organs need to be examined in close detail during a post-mortem and these investigations can take several weeks to complete. The pathologist will return the organs to the body after the post-mortem has been completed. If you wish, you'll usually be able to view the body after the examination. Once release papers have been issued, the undertakers you've appointed will be able to collect the body from the mortuary in preparation for the funeral. "},"Title":"Post-mortem"},"Anal itching":{"Treatment":{" ":"Treatment for itchy bottom usually involves following simple self-care measures for a few months. If necessary, medication may be prescribed to help ease the symptoms. If you still have an itchy bottom after two months, or if it returns, you may need to follow this self-care advice for longer. ","Topical corticosteroids":"If the skin around your anus is sore and inflamed due to itching, your GP may prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid (an ointment that contains steroids). Applying this directly to the affected area will help relieve the inflammation and ease the urge to scratch. In most cases, using a topical corticosteroid will help ease the itch. However, it can sometimes make the itching worse. Speak to your GP immediately if your itchy bottom gets worse after using topical corticosteroids. ","Antihistamines":"If your sleep is disturbed due to itching at night, using an antihistamine may help. Antihistamines are medicines that work by counteracting the action of histamine (a chemical released during an allergic reaction). Some antihistamines also have a sedating effect (they make you drowsy). Your GP may prescribe chlorphenamine or hydroxyzine. These should be taken at night and shouldn't be used for longer than two weeks, because after this time the sedating effect may no longer work. You need to be aware that sedating antihistamines can affect your ability to drive or operate machinery, and the sedating effect may be stronger if you drink alcohol. When diagnosing itchy bottom, your GP will try to determine an underlying cause. If they identify the cause, such as a bacterial infection or skin condition, it will also need to be treated for your itchy bottom to be properly managed. For example, a bacterial infection may need to be treated with antibiotics. If the underlying cause is left untreated, your itchy bottom may return. An itchy bottom in children is often caused by worms. If treatment for worms is recommended, other family members with the same symptom should also be treated. Go back to your GP if your itchy bottom doesn't improve after following self-care measures, such as keeping your bottom clean and dry, and using medication to provide relief from the itching. Your GP may then refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) or a colorectal surgeon (who specialises in conditions that affect the large intestine and anus). Page last reviewed: 23/06/2016 Next review due: 23/06/2019 ","Keeping clean and dry":"If you have an itchy bottom, you should keep your bottom as clean and dry as possible. The best way to do this is to use water to gently clean your anus and the surrounding skin. Clean your bottom in this way after every bowel movement and before going to bed each night. You can use soap to clean your bottom, but make sure it's mild and unperfumed so it causes less irritation to your skin. Wash all of the soap away afterwards. After washing, gently dry your bottom. Avoid rubbing the area vigorously, as this may irritate your skin. Instead, gently pat the skin dry using a soft towel. You can also dry your bottom using a hairdryer on a low heat setting. When you're away from home, you can use damp toilet paper after passing stools, before gently patting your bottom dry. If you have a tendency to sweat, or if your bottom becomes very moist, putting a cotton tissue in your underwear will help absorb the moisture around your anal area. ","Diet":"Some foods may make your itchy bottom worse. If the urge to scratch your bottom is greater after eating certain foods, try cutting them out of your diet completely or reducing the amount you eat. Foods that may make your itchy bottom worse include: tomatoes spicy foods citrus fruits, such as oranges nuts chocolate dairy products coffee excessive amounts of liquids, such as milk, beer or wine  ","Soothing ointments":"Your GP may prescribe an ointment or cream to soothe the skin around your anus. You'll usually have to apply it in the morning and at night, as well as after each bowel movement. ","Fibre":"Your GP may recommend that you follow a diet that keeps your stools regular and well-formed.  This means your stools won't be loose (runny), but you won't need to strain when you go to the toilet. Loose stools can irritate your anus. Straining to pass hard stools may cause haemorrhoids (piles) to develop. Piles are swellings that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around your anus. Including more fibre in your diet will make your stools softer and easier to pass. Fibre can be found in: grains \u2013 such as wholegrain bread pulses \u2013 edible seeds that grow in a pod, such as peas, beans and lentils oats \u2013 which are in some breakfast cereals fruit and vegetables  Read more about why fibre is important. While waiting for the above self-care measures to take effect, your GP may prescribe medication to help ease your itchy bottom. However, you shouldn't use topical treatments (those applied directly to your skin) for more than two weeks, because they may start to harm your skin if used for long periods. ","Other self-care measures":"As well as keeping your bottom clean and dry, there are a number of other self-care measures you can undertake. For example, you should: use soft toilet tissue bath or shower daily wear loose-fitting cotton underwear and change it daily only put underwear on when your bottom is completely dry avoid wearing tight clothing; women should wear stockings instead of tights use a light duvet at night so you don't get too hot avoid using scented soaps, bubble bath, perfumes or powders around your anus keep your fingernails short to try to keep your skin being damaged from scratching wear cotton gloves while sleeping so that you cause less damage to your skin if you scratch It may be difficult, but you should try to resist the urge to scratch your bottom, as scratching will only make the problem worse. ","URL":"/conditions/Itchybottom"},"Introduction":{" ":"Itchy bottom (pruritus ani) is characterised by a strong urge to scratch the skin around your anus.  The anus is the opening at the lower end of the digestive system, where solid waste leaves your body. As itchy bottom is a symptom rather than a condition itself, many cases have an underlying cause, for example: a bacterial infection \u2013 such as those that cause streptococcal infections a skin condition \u2013 such as atopic eczema, where the skin becomes red, dry and flaky haemorrhoids (piles) \u2013 swellings that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around the anus In children, an itchy bottom is often caused by threadworms. But not all cases of itchy bottom have an identifiable cause. An itchy bottom can be made worse by: heat woollen clothing or blankets moisture soiling yourself stress or anxiety Read more about the causes of itchy bottom.  See your GP if you've had an itchy bottom for more than a few days, so they can try to find the cause. They may ask about: how often you wash and whether you use creams, powders or soaps around your anus the duration and pattern of your itching \u2013 such as whether your symptoms are worse at night or after eating certain foods other symptoms \u2013 such as bleeding or other discharge from your anus Your GP will usually want to examine the skin around your anus and may ask to carry out a digital rectal examination (DRE) to rule out more serious underlying conditions. You may feel awkward, but it's nothing to be embarrassed or worried about, as this is one of the most common examinations GPs carry out. If necessary, you may be referred to a specialist for further investigation and treatment. An itchy bottom is usually easy to treat at home. Some ways of easing an itchy bottom include: keeping your bottom clean and dry avoid using scented soaps use soft toilet tissue avoid scratching Your GP can prescribe creams or ointments to help relieve your symptoms while the above self-care measures are taking effect. Check with your GP or pharmacist about how long you should use them for. If your itchy bottom is caused by an underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection or piles, it will also need to be treated. Read more about treating an itchy bottom. Frequently scratching your bottom may damage or tear the delicate skin around your anus. This may lead to problems such as: thick and leathery skin (lichenification) sore and broken down skin (ulceration) the top layer of skin being worn away (excoriation) infection The earlier these complications are diagnosed and treated, the quicker you'll recover. You should visit your GP if the skin around your anus changes or feels painful. If the cause of your itchy bottom can't be identified and treated, it may last for long periods of time (known as chronic itchy bottom). This may cause you to feel embarrassed, anxious or depressed. As the urge to scratch is often worse at night, your sleep may also be disturbed, leaving you feeling tired during the day. Speak to your GP if your itchy bottom is making you anxious or depressed, or if it's significantly affecting your sleep.

However, it can sometimes be a symptom of another problem or underlying condition. An itchy bottom may be a sign that your body is trying to deal with an infection. The infection may be: bacterial \u2013 such as the streptococcal bacteria that causes streptococcal infections, or the staphylococcal bacteria that causes staphylococcal infections fungal \u2013 such as the Candida albicans fungus that causes vaginal thrush (itching, irritation and swelling of the vagina and surrounding area) parasitic \u2013 such as threadworms (small worm parasites that infect the intestines), or scabies (tiny mites that burrow into the skin) viral \u2013 such as the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores An itchy bottom can sometimes be a symptom of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If you've had unprotected sex and think you could have an STI, visit your local sexual health clinic. They can offer advice and provide testing and treatment. Gastrointestinal conditions affect your digestive tract (your mouth, throat, stomach, intestines and anus). Gastrointestinal conditions that may cause an itchy bottom include: haemorrhoids (piles) \u2013 swellings in and around your anus that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels anal fistula \u2013 where a small channel (tract) develops between your anal canal (the last section of the large intestine) and the surface of your skin, near the anus anal fissure \u2013 a tear or ulcer (open sore) that develops in the lining of the anal canal sphincter incompetence \u2013 where the sphincter (the ring of muscle that opens and closes your anus) stops working properly, causing bowel incontinence long-term diarrhoea \u2013 passing loose, watery stools long-term constipation \u2013 an inability to completely empty your bowels Some skin conditions can affect any area of skin on your body, including the skin around your anus. Skin conditions that can be associated with an itchy bottom include: psoriasis \u2013 where red, flaky, crusty patches of skin develop because your skin cells reproduce too quickly contact dermatitis \u2013 where your skin reacts to certain substances (allergens), causing it to become inflamed lichen sclerosus \u2013 a long-term skin disorder that causes itchy or sore white spots to develop on the skin around the genitals atopic eczema \u2013 where your skin becomes dry, red and flaky Systemic conditions affect your whole body and can sometimes make your bottom feel itchy. Systemic conditions include: diabetes \u2013 a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high kidney failure \u2013 where your kidneys stop working properly iron deficiency anaemia \u2013 a decrease in the number of red, oxygen-carrying blood cells, causing tiredness and a lack of energy (lethargy)  overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) \u2013 too much thyroid hormone in your body Some types of medication, including those applied directly to your skin (topical), may make your bottom feel itchy. For example, if you use a cream to treat haemorrhoids, it may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus and make the itching worse.

Several over-the-counter treatments are also available if your flatulence is becoming a problem. ","Self care advice":"You should try to avoid eating foods high in unabsorbable carbohydrates. For a list of these foods, see causes of flatulence. Certain processed foods should also be avoided as they can contain ingredients that cause flatulence, including: any foods with artifical sweeteners sugar-free sweets or chewing gum fizzy drinks However, it's still important to eat a healthy balanced diet, including at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Choose foods containing carbohydrates that are easy to digest. These include: potatoes rice lettuce bananas grapes citrus fruits, such as oranges yoghurt It's important to note that people react differently to certain foods, so some foods listed above may still cause flatulence. You may find it useful to keep a food diary to see whether certain foods make your symptoms better or worse. You may also find it useful to eat six small meals a day rather than three large ones. Smaller meals are easier to digest and may produce less gas. There's some evidence to suggest drinking peppermint tea can help improve the symptoms of flatulence. There's also some evidence that small amounts of ginger can help with digestion or an upset stomach, which may be causing flatulence. However, pregnant women should consult their doctor before taking ginger. When eating, make sure you chew food slowly to reduce the amount of air you swallow. This will also help with digestion. Avoid chewing gum as it can also cause you to swallow more air than usual. You should also give up smoking, if you smoke. Smoking can cause you to swallow more air than usual, and tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system. See stop smoking for more information and advice about quitting smoking. Getting plenty of exercise can help improve the functioning of your digestive system and bowel. It has also been shown to help with bloating and the passage of gas. ","URL":"/conditions/flatulence","Medications and other remedies":"There are several over-the-counter remedies that can help treat the symptoms of flatulence, some of which are described below. Charcoal tablets are a type of medication available over the counter from pharmacists. The charcoal absorbs gas in the digestive system, which helps reduce symptoms. Charcoal tablets may not be suitable for you if you are currently taking other medication. This is because the charcoal might absorb the medication and make it less effective. If you are taking other medication, ask your GP or pharmacist for advice before taking charcoal tablets. Clothing containing activated charcoal, or charcoal pads placed inside clothing, can help absorb foul-smelling gas released during flatulence. These products can be purchased online. Simethicone is another over-the-counter medication that can also sometimes help with gas problems. Alpha-galactosidase is a dietary supplement that may help improve the digestion of carbohydrates and reduce symptoms of flatulence. It's found in a product called Beano, which has been shown to have some effect in reducing flatulence and is available from some pharmacists and health food shops. Probiotics may also be useful in treating flatulence. Probiotics are a dietary supplement, usually sold in liquid or capsule form, which encourages the growth of \"friendly bacteria\" in your digestive system. The \"friendly bacteria\" should help digestion and reduce the symptoms of flatulence, particularly in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotic yoghurts may also help, but avoid those with artificial sweeteners or added fibre.

You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms. See your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome \u2013 for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas. You should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as: persistent abdominal pain and bloating recurring episodes of diarrhoea or constipation unexplained weight loss bowel incontinence  blood in your stools (faeces) signs of an infection, such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills, joint pain and muscle pain These symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection. ","Why it happens":"When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting (flatulence) or burping (belching). Sometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit. Excessive flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be related to an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of flatulence. ","Introduction ":"Flatulence is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage. It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\". Farting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with changes to your diet and lifestyle. Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about 5 to 15 times a day. ","Controlling the problem":"Excessive flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: avoiding foods known to cause flatulence eating smaller and more frequent meals eating and drinking slowly exercising regularly There are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone.

Foods containing a high amount of unabsorbable carbohydrates include: beans broccoli cabbage cauliflower artichokes raisins pulses lentils onions prunes apples Brussels sprouts Foods containing a lot of unrefined cereal fibre, such as bran, can also sometimes cause problems with wind and bloating. Other foods and drinks that contain a sweetener called sorbitol (such as sugar-free gum or slimming products) or a type of sugar called fructose (such as fruit juice) can also cause flatulence. This means chewing sugar-free gum can cause flatulence from both the sweetener and swallowing air. Certain foods, such as cabbage or onions, can lead to the production of gases containing sulphur, which can result in foul-smelling wind. However, the production of smelly wind can vary from person to person depending on what you eat, so it's up to you to work out which foods cause the most smell. ","Causes of flatulence ":"There are several natural causes of flatulence. Flatulence can also be caused by some health conditions related to the digestive system, or as a side effect of certain medicines. ","Health conditions":"Certain health conditions can cause symptoms of flatulence, including: indigestion constipation  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common digestive condition, which can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation coeliac disease \u2013 an intolerance to a protein called gluten, found in wheat, rye and barley lactose intolerance \u2013 where the body is unable to break down lactose (a natural sugar found in milk and dairy products) and can't absorb it into the blood gastroenteritis \u2013 a stomach and bowel infection malabsorption \u2013 where the intestines are unable to absorb nutrients properly giardiasis \u2013 an infection of the digestive system caused by tiny parasites ","Swallowing air":"It's perfectly normal to swallow air while breathing and eating. However, it's easy to swallow a lot more air than usual without realising it. This can cause excessive flatulence. Excess air can be swallowed by: chewing gum smoking sucking on pen tops or hard sweets having loose-fitting dentures not chewing food slowly and thoroughly \u2013 swallowing large pieces of food causes you to swallow more air Hot and fizzy drinks also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your stomach, although this is more likely to cause belching rather than flatulence.

This usually involves working from a book or computer programme for around six weeks or longer. In some cases, you may be closely supported by a trained therapist who you'll speak to every week or two. Some treatments only involve minimal or occasional contact with a therapist, who monitors your progress. There are numerous books and courses that can help you learn to cope with your anxiety, but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends trying treatments based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychological treatment that can help you understand your condition better and how your problems, thoughts, feelings and behaviour affect each other. The aim of CBT-based treatments is to help you learn ways to manage your anxiety by modifying negative or unhelpful thoughts and behaviour. Read more about self-help therapies for anxiety. ","Contact support groups":"Support groups can give you advice on how to manage your anxiety. They're also a good way to meet other people with similar experiences. Examples of support groups you may find useful include: Anxiety UK Mind Rethink Mental Illness Support groups can often arrange face-to-face meetings, where you can talk about your difficulties and problems with other people. Many support groups also provide support and guidance over the phone or in writing.

It also encourages your brain to release serotonin, which can improve your mood. Examples of good aerobic exercises include: walking fast or jogging swimming cycling tennis hiking football or rugby aerobics You should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week. Moderate-intensity exercise should raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster. Read more information and advice about: exercise getting active for mental wellbeing ","Avoid caffeine":"Drinking too much caffeine can make you more anxious than normal. This is because caffeine can disrupt your sleep and also speed up your heartbeat. If you're tired, you're less likely to be able to control your anxious feelings. Avoiding drinks containing caffeine \u2013 such as coffee, tea, fizzy drinks and energy drinks \u2013 may help to reduce your anxiety levels. Read more about water, drinks and your health. ","Avoid smoking and drinking":"Smoking and alcohol have been shown to make anxiety worse. Only drinking alcohol in moderation or stopping smoking may help to reduce your anxiety. To reduce the risk of harming your health:    men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week   Fourteen units is equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine.  Read how stopping smoking can reduce your anxiety.

Before you begin any form of treatment, your GP should discuss all your treatment options with you. They should outline the pros and cons of each and make sure you're aware of any possible risks or side effects. With your GP, you can make a decision on the most suitable treatment, taking into account your personal preferences and circumstances. If you have other problems alongside GAD, such as depression and drug or alcohol misuse, these may need to be treated before having treatment specifically for GAD. ","Referral to a specialist":"If you've tried the treatments mentioned above and have significant symptoms of GAD, you may want to discuss with your GP whether you should be referred to a mental health specialist. A referral will work differently in different areas of the UK, but you'll usually be referred to your community mental health team. These teams include a range of specialists, including:  psychiatrists psychiatric nurses clinical psychologists occupational therapists social workers An appropriate mental health specialist from your local team will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They'll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. They may also ask about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends. Your specialist will then be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to treat your symptoms. As part of this plan, you may be offered a treatment you haven't tried before, which might be one of the psychological treatments or medications mentioned above. Alternatively, you may be offered a combination of a psychological treatment with a medication, or a combination of two different medications. Page last reviewed: 01/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","Initial treatment":"At first, your GP may suggest trying an individual self-help course for a month or two, to see if it can help you learn to cope with your anxiety. This usually involves working from a book or computer programme on your own (you'll be given advice before you start), with only occasional contact with your doctor. Alternatively, you may prefer to go on a group course where you and a few other people with similar problems meet with a therapist every week to learn ways to tackle your anxiety. See self-help tips for anxiety for more information on these treatments. If these initial treatments don't help, you'll usually be offered either a more intensive psychological treatment or medication. These are described below. ","Medication":"If the psychological treatments above haven't helped or you would prefer not to try them, you'll usually be offered medication. Your GP can prescribe a variety of different types of medication to treat GAD. Some medication is designed to be taken on a short-term basis, while other medicines are prescribed for longer periods. Depending on your symptoms, you may need medicine to treat your physical symptoms, as well as your psychological ones. If you're considering taking medication for GAD, your GP should discuss the different options with you in detail before you start a course of treatment, including: the different types of medication length of treatment side effects and possible interactions with other medicines You should also have regular appointments with your doctor to assess your progress when you're taking medication for GAD. These will usually take place every two to four weeks for the first three months, then every three months after that. Tell your GP if you think you may be experiencing side effects from your medication. They may be able to adjust your dose or prescribe an alternative medication. The main medications you may be offered to treat GAD are described below. In most cases, the first medication you'll be offered will be a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This type of medication works by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Examples of SSRIs you may be prescribed include: sertraline escitalopram paroxetine SSRIs can be taken on a long-term basis but, as with all antidepressants, they can take several weeks to start working. You'll usually be started on a low dose, which is gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine. Common side effects of SSRIs include: feeling agitated  feeling or being sick indigestion diarrhoea or constipation  loss of appetite and weight loss dizziness blurred vision  dry mouth excessive sweating  headaches problems sleeping (insomnia) or drowsiness low sex drive difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) These side effects should improve over time, although some \u2013 such as sexual problems \u2013 can persist. If your medication isn't helping after about two months of treatment, or if it's causing unpleasant side effects, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI. When you and your GP decide it's appropriate for you to stop taking your medication, you'll normally have your dose slowly reduced over the course of a few weeks to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects. Never stop taking your medication unless your GP specifically advises you to. If SSRIs don't help ease your anxiety, you may be prescribed a different type of antidepressant known as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). This type of medicine increases the amount of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. Examples of SNRIs you may be prescribed include: venlafaxine duloxetine Common side effects of SNRIs include:  feeling sick  headaches drowsiness  dizziness  dry mouth  constipation  insomnia  sweating SNRIs can also increase your blood pressure, so your blood pressure will be monitored regularly during treatment. As with SSRIs, some of the side effects \u2013 such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious \u2013 are more common in the first one or two weeks of treatment, but these usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication. If SSRIs and SNRIs aren't suitable for you, you may be offered pregabalin. This is a medication known as an anticonvulsant, which is used to treat conditions such as epilepsy. However, it's also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety. Side effects of pregabalin can include: drowsiness dizziness increased appetite and weight gain blurred vision headaches dry mouth vertigo Pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs or SNRIs. Benzodiazepines are a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment during a particularly severe period of anxiety, because they help ease the symptoms within 30 to 90 minutes of taking the medication. If you're prescribed a benzodiazepine, it will usually be diazepam. Although benzodiazepines are very effective in treating the symptoms of anxiety, they can't be used for long periods of time because they can become addictive if used for longer than four weeks. Benzodiazepines also start to lose their effectiveness after this time. For these reasons, you won't usually be prescribed benzodiazepines for any longer than two to four weeks at a time. Side effects of benzodiazepines can include:  drowsiness difficulty concentrating headaches vertigo tremor (an uncontrollable shake or tremble in part of the body) low sex drive As drowsiness is a particularly common side effect of benzodiazepines, your ability to drive or operate machinery may be affected by taking this medication. You should avoid these activities during treatment. ","URL":"/conditions/anxiety","Psychological treatment":"If you've been diagnosed with GAD, you'll usually be advised to try psychological treatment before you're prescribed medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for GAD. Studies of different treatments for GAD have found that the benefits of CBT may last longer than those of medication, but no single treatment is best for everyone. CBT helps you to understand how your problems, thoughts, feelings and behaviour affect each other. It can also help you to question your negative and anxious thoughts, and do things you would usually avoid because they make you anxious. CBT usually involves meeting with a specially trained and accredited therapist for a one-hour session every week for three to four months. Your therapist should carry out CBT in a standardised way according to a treatment manual, and they should receive regular supervision to support them in providing the most effective treatments. Mindfulness and applied relaxation are alternative types of psychological treatment that can be as effective as CBT in treating GAD. Mindfulness works by focusing your awareness on the present moment and by acknowledging and accepting certain feelings. Being mindful can reduce anxiety caused by the fear of actual situations or sensations, or anticipated ones. It helps to counter the sense of \"tunnel vision\" that may develop during anxiety. Although mindfulness originates from Buddhism, it doesn't require you to change or take on any religious beliefs. Applied relaxation focuses on relaxing your muscles in a particular way during situations that usually cause anxiety. The technique needs to be taught by a trained therapist, but generally involves: learning how to relax your muscles learning how to relax your muscles quickly and in response to a trigger, such as the word \"relax\" practising relaxing your muscles in situations that make you anxious As with CBT, applied relaxation therapy will usually mean meeting with a therapist for a one-hour session every week for three to four months. "},"Introduction":{"When to see your GP":"Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or causing you distress. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to find out if you could have GAD. Read more about diagnosing GAD. ","Introduction ":"Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe. Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life \u2013 for example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal. However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily lives. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including: panic disorder phobias \u2013 such as agoraphobia or claustrophobia  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) social anxiety disorder (social phobia) However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.  People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. As soon as one anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue. GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to person, but can include: feeling restless or worried having trouble concentrating or sleeping dizziness or heart palpitations Read about the symptoms of GAD. ","What causes GAD?":"The exact cause of GAD isn't fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role. Research has suggested that these may include: overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood the genes you inherit from your parents \u2013 you're estimated to be five times more likely to develop GAD if you have a close relative with the condition having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying having a painful long-term health condition, such as arthritis having a history of drug or alcohol misuse However, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason. ","How GAD is treated":"GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can ease your symptoms. These include: psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication \u2013 such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as:  going on a self-help course exercising regularly stopping smoking cutting down on the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink Read how stopping smoking can improve your anxiety.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can be difficult to diagnose. In some cases, it can also be difficult to distinguish from other mental health conditions, such as depression. You may have GAD if: your worrying significantly affects your daily life, including your job and social life your worries are extremely stressful and upsetting you worry about all sorts of things and have a tendency to think the worst your worrying is uncontrollable you've felt worried nearly every day for at least six months ","Talking to your GP about anxiety":"Your GP may ask you questions about: any physical or psychological symptoms and how long you've had them your worries, fears and emotions your personal life You may find it difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life. However, it's important that your GP understands your symptoms and circumstances, so the correct diagnosis can be made. You're most likely to be diagnosed with GAD if you've had symptoms for six months or more. Finding it difficult to manage your feelings of anxiety is also an indication that you may have the condition. To help with the diagnosis, your GP may carry out a physical examination or blood tests to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as: anaemia (a deficiency in iron or vitamin B12 and folate) an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) Page last reviewed: 01/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/anxiety"},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder ":"Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can affect you both physically and mentally.

You should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress. ","Anxiety triggers":"If you're anxious because of a specific phobia or because of panic disorder, you'll usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (fear of confined spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety. However, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you're feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it and you may start to worry that there's no solution.

"}},"Ataxia":{"Types":{"Types of ataxia ":"Some types of ataxia affect children from an early age, while other types may not develop until much later in adulthood. Depending on the type of ataxia, the symptoms may stay the same, get progressively worse, or slowly improve. Some of the main types of ataxia are described below. Read about the causes of ataxia for information about why these different types of ataxia develop. ","Friedreich's ataxia":"Friedreich's ataxia is the most common type of hereditary ataxia (caused by genes you've inherited). It's thought to affect at least 1 in every 50,000 people. Symptoms usually first develop before the age of 25, although it can develop in people much older than this. Signs and symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia can include: problems with balance and co-ordination, often causing wobbliness, clumsiness and frequent falls increasingly slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria) increasing weakness in the legs \u2013 many people find walking difficult and need to use a wheelchair after around 10 to 20 years difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) total or partial vision loss and hearing loss  diabetes  thickening of the heart muscles (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), which can cause chest pain, breathlessness and an irregular heartbeat loss of sensation in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy) The symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia usually get gradually worse over many years. People with the condition tend to have a shorter life expectancy than normal. Many people live until at least their 30s, and some can live into their 60s or beyond. ","Ataxia-telangiectasia":"Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a rarer type of hereditary ataxia, affecting around 1 in every 100,000 children. Symptoms usually begin in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop later. Signs and symptoms of AT can include: difficulty walking \u2013 most children need to use a wheelchair by 10 years of age increasingly slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria) difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) small spider-like clusters of red blood vessels in the corner of their eyes and on their cheeks (telangiectasias) very slow eye movements, which may mean the person has to move their head a lot to compensate for this a weakened immune system \u2013 children with AT are more vulnerable to infections, particularly infections of the sinuses, lungs and airways, such as pneumonia an increased risk of cancer, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma \u2013 up to 40% of people with AT will develop cancer The symptoms of AT tend to get worse quite quickly. People with the condition usually live until the age of 19 to 25, although some may live into their 50s. ","Other types of ataxia":"There are also a number of other types of ataxia that tend to have similar symptoms to those mentioned above. These include: acquired ataxia \u2013 this can affect people of any age and usually develops very quickly over the course of a few days, or sometimes hours; it may improve over time, stay the same or get slowly worse idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA) \u2013 this usually begins at around 50 years of age and gets slowly worse over time ataxia with vitamin E deficiency \u2013 a similar condition to Friedreich's ataxia caused by problems with the body's ability to use vitamin E in the diet; it's often possible to control the symptoms with vitamin E supplements Page last reviewed: 12/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","Episodic ataxia":"Episodic ataxia is a rare and unusual type of hereditary ataxia where someone experiences episodes of ataxia, but the rest of the time they have no or only mild symptoms. During an episode, someone with episodic ataxia may experience: problems with balance and co-ordination slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria) muscle spasms involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) vertigo, migraines and tinnitus Episodic ataxia usually first develops during the teenage years. The episodes can last from several minutes to hours and are usually the result of certain triggers, such as sudden movement, stress, exercise, caffeine or alcohol. The symptoms of episodic ataxia may disappear as a person gets older, although sometimes the condition gets gradually worse over time. Medication can often help control attacks, and life expectancy is usually normal. ","URL":"/conditions/Ataxia","Spinocerebellar ataxias":"Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of hereditary ataxias that often don't begin until adulthood, affecting people from the age of 25 up to 80, depending on the type of SCA. Occasionally, some types of SCA begin in childhood. The symptoms vary depending on the type of SCA. They can include: problems with balance and co-ordination \u2013 many people find walking difficult and need to use a wheelchair after a few years increasingly slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria) difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) muscle stiffness and cramps loss of sensation in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy) memory loss and difficulties with spoken language slow eye movement, which means people have to move their head to compensate reduced bladder control (urinary urgency or incontinence) Ataxia UK has more detailed information about common subtypes of SCA. "},"Treatment":{"Treating the underlying cause":"In a few cases of ataxia, it may be possible to improve the condition or stop it getting worse by treating the underlying cause. For example: ataxia with vitamin E deficiency can often be controlled or improved with vitamin E supplements episodic ataxia can often be controlled with a medication called acetazolamide and by avoiding triggers such as stress, alcohol and caffeine acquired ataxia can sometimes be treated depending on the specific cause \u2013 for example, antibiotic or antiviral medication may help if it's caused by an infection If acquired ataxia is caused by serious underlying brain damage, such as damage from a stroke or a severe head injury, it may not be possible to improve the condition. If this is the case, the treatments mentioned above can be used to control your symptoms. ","Treating ataxia ":"The treatment for ataxia can vary depending on exact what type of ataxia you have. It's sometimes possible to treat the underlying cause of the condition so it improves or stops getting worse, but in most cases this isn't possible and you'll have treatment to relieve your symptoms. ","Treating the symptoms":"Treatments for the various symptoms of ataxia are discussed below, although you may not experience all of the problems described. A speech and language therapist will be able to help with two of the most common symptoms of ataxia \u2013 slurred speech (dysarthria) and swallowing problems (dysphagia). The therapist will be able to advise you about how to make your voice sound clearer. For example, they may suggest: changing your posture to improve the quality of your voice carrying out exercises to strengthen the muscles used when speaking speaking more slowly to emphasise each word  using breathing techniques to improve your speech If your speech gets worse, you may want to consider using speaking aids such as a laptop computer connected to a voice synthesiser. Your therapist will be able to advise you about the equipment available. To treat dysphagia, your therapist will be able to teach you exercises to stimulate the nerves used to trigger your swallowing reflex and strengthen the muscles used when swallowing. You may also be referred to a dietitian for dietary advice. For example, your diet may need to include food that's easier to swallow. Read more about treating dysphagia. The aim of occupational therapy is to teach you how to adapt to your gradual loss of mobility and develop new skills you can use to carry out daily activities. An occupational therapist may be able to teach you how to use a wheelchair and other mobility devices. They can also advise you about modifications you can make to your house, such as installing guide rails or a stair lift, to help make your life easier. If you have ataxia, physiotherapy can help you maintain the use of your arms and legs, and prevent your muscles weakening or getting stuck in one position (contractures). A physiotherapist will be able to teach you a number of physical exercises you can do every day to help strengthen and stretch your muscles. They may also be able to recommend walking aids to help you get around. If you're experiencing muscle spasms, cramps and stiffness, muscle relaxant medication such as baclofen or tizanidine may be used to control these symptoms. If these aren't effective, an injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) may be given. This works by blocking the signals from your brain to the affected muscles. The effects of the injection will usually last for up to three months. Bladder problems, such as urinary urgency or, more rarely, urinary incontinence, sometimes affect people with ataxia. In some cases, bladder problems can be controlled using a number of self care techniques, such as limiting fluid intake during the day, planning regular trips to the toilet, and avoiding drinks known to stimulate urine production, such as caffeine and alcohol. Some people may also require a type of medication known as antimuscarinic. This will help relax the bladder, reducing the frequent urge to urinate. Occasional injections of botulinum toxin into the bladder may also help. Others may find it difficult to empty their bladder completely when they go to the toilet. This can lead to small amounts of urine leaking out later on. In such cases, it may be necessary to insert a small tube known as a urinary catheter into the bladder to help drain the urine. Eye problems are common in some cases of ataxia. Oscillopsia is an eye problem caused by involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side or up and down. It can cause visual disruption, making tasks such as reading difficult. This can sometimes be treated using medication such as gabapentin to control the muscles that move the eyes. Some people with ataxia experience double vision, where you see two images of a single object. It may be possible to treat this by attaching a wedge-shaped piece of glass or plastic called a prism to your glasses.  As a result of underlying nerve damage, some men with ataxia will experience difficulty getting or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). This can often be treated using a group of medications known as phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra). These help increase blood flow to the penis. Read more about treating erectile dysfunction. Many people with neurological conditions such as ataxia report feeling extremely tired and lethargic (lacking in energy). It's thought this is partly caused by disturbed sleep and the physical efforts of having to cope with the loss of co-ordination.  A physiotherapist may be able to help you increase your stamina levels, and an occupational therapist can advise you about how to adapt your daily activities to help you cope with fatigue better. Read more about coping with fatigue. Damage to the nerve endings can result in nerve pain. The medical term for nerve pain is neuropathic pain, which is often experienced as a burning, aching or shooting pain, or sometimes tingling, in certain parts of the body. Traditional painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen aren't usually effective in treating neuropathic pain, so you may be prescribed a number of medications, such as amitriptyline, gabapentin or pregabalin. Read more about treating neuropathic pain. Cardiomyopathy (damage to the heart muscle) is a common problem in some types of ataxia. This can be serious as it can place strain on the heart, affect the normal blood flow through the heart, and cause heartbeat irregularities (arrhythmias). If you develop cardiomyopathy, you'll receive regular check-ups from a cardiologist (a heart specialist). You may need to take medication to treat any problems as they develop. Living with a long-term condition such as ataxia can be stressful and can often cause intense feelings of anxiety. In some cases, this can trigger the onset of depression. Signs that you may be depressed include feeling down or hopeless during the past month and no longer taking pleasure in the things you enjoy. You should contact your GP or MDT for advice if you think you may be depressed. There are several treatments for depression, such as antidepressants and talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

This may include: speech and language therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems physiotherapy to help with movement problems occupational therapy to help you cope with the day-to-day problems medication to control muscle, bladder, heart and eye problems In a few cases, it's possible to improve ataxia or stop it getting worse by treating the underlying cause. Read more about treating ataxia. ","Introduction ":"Ataxia is a term for a group of disorders that affect co-ordination, balance and speech. Any part of the body can be affected, but people with ataxia often have difficulties with: balance and walking speaking swallowing tasks that require a high degree of control, such as writing and eating vision  The exact symptoms and their severity vary depending on the type of ataxia a person has. ","What causes ataxia?":"Ataxia usually results from damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum, but it can also be caused by damage to other parts of the nervous system. This damage can be part of an underlying condition such as MS, or can be caused by a head injury, lack of oxygen to the brain, or long-term, excessive alcohol consumption. Hereditary ataxia is caused by a faulty gene passed on by family members, who may or may not be affected. Read more about the causes of ataxia. ","Outlook":"The outlook for ataxia can vary considerably and largely depends on the type of ataxia you have. Some types may remain relatively stable or even improve with time, but most will get progressively worse over many years. Life expectancy is generally shorter than normal for people with hereditary ataxia, although some people can live well into their 50s, 60s or beyond. In more severe cases, the condition can be fatal in childhood or early adulthood. For acquired ataxia, the outlook depends on the underlying cause. Some cases may improve or stay the same, while other cases may get gradually worse over time and reduce life expectancy. ","Types of ataxia":"There are many different types of ataxia, which can be divided into three broad categories: acquired ataxia \u2013 where symptoms develop as the result of trauma, a stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), a brain tumour, nutritional deficiencies, or other problems that damage the brain or nervous system hereditary ataxia \u2013 where symptoms develop slowly over many years and are caused by faulty genes that a person inherits from their parents; the most common type is Friedreich's ataxia idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA) \u2013 where the brain is progressively damaged over time for reasons that are unclear Read more about the main types of ataxia. ","Information about you":"If you have ataxia, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Page last reviewed: 12/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Ataxia"},"Causes":{"Acquired ataxia":"Acquired ataxia can have a wide range of potential causes, including: severe head injury \u2013 after a car crash or fall, for example  bacterial brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis (an infection of the brain itself) viral infection \u2013 some viral infections, such as chickenpox or measles, can spread to the brain, although this is very rare  conditions that disrupt the supply of blood to the brain, such as a stroke, haemorrhage or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) cerebral palsy \u2013 a condition that can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth multiple sclerosis \u2013 a long-term condition that damages the nerve fibres of the central nervous system sustained long-term alcohol misuse an underactive thyroid gland vitamin B12 deficiency brain tumours and other types of cancer certain toxic chemicals, such as mercury and some solvents \u2013 these can trigger ataxia if a person is exposed to enough of them medications such as benzodiazepines can occasionally trigger ataxia as a side effect ","Causes of ataxia ":"Ataxia is usually caused by damage to a part of the brain known as the cerebellum, but it can also be caused by damage to the spinal cord or other nerves. The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves that runs down the spine and connects the brain to all other parts of the body. The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain and is responsible for controlling: walking and sitting balance limb co-ordination eye movements speech  Damage can occur as a result of injury or illness (acquired ataxia) or because the cerebellum or spinal cord degenerates because of an inherited faulty gene (hereditary ataxia). Sometimes there's no clear reason why the cerebellum and spinal cord become damaged. This is the case for people with idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOA).  ","Hereditary ataxia":"Hereditary ataxia is caused by a faulty gene. Genes are units of DNA that determine a particular characteristic, such as sex or eye colour. A baby receives two copies of every gene \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. Ataxia can be inherited in two possible ways: autosomal recessive \u2013 Friedreich's ataxia and ataxia-telangiectasia are inherited in this way autosomal dominant \u2013 episodic ataxia and some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia are inherited in this way These are described in more detail below. When ataxia is autosomal recessive, it means the affected person has inherited the mutated gene from both their mother and their father. If they only received one mutated gene from either parent, the other normal gene will cancel out the effects of the faulty gene and they will be a carrier of the condition. This means they don't have the condition themselves, but could pass it on to their children if their partner is also a carrier of the faulty gene. It's estimated around 1 in every 85 people are carriers of the mutated gene that causes Friedreich's ataxia, and around 1 in every 100 people are carriers of the mutated gene that causes ataxia-telangiectasia. If two carriers of the mutated gene were to have a baby, there would be a: one in four chance the baby would receive a pair of normal genes one in two chance the baby would receive one normal gene and one mutated gene (be a carrier) one in four chance the baby would receive a pair of mutated genes and develop ataxia If you have autosomal recessive ataxia and your partner is a carrier, there is a one in two chance your baby will receive one normal gene and one mutated gene and will be a carrier, and a one in two chance your baby will receive a pair of mutated genes and develop ataxia. If you have autosomal recessive ataxia and your partner doesn't and they aren't a carrier, there's no risk of any of your children developing ataxia. This is because your mutated gene will be cancelled out by your partner's normal gene. Your children will be carriers, however. When ataxia is autosomal dominant, you can develop the condition if you receive a single faulty gene, either from your mother or father. This is because the mutation is strong enough to override the other normal gene. If you have autosomal dominant ataxia, any children you have will have a one in two chance of developing ataxia.

","Family and medical history":"Your GP may ask whether you have any family history of ataxia. They will also want to know about the progression of your symptoms. They might carry out a simple assessment of your balance, walking and co-ordination. Your GP may also ask how much alcohol you drink and whether you're taking any form of medication. This is because excessive drinking and certain medications can cause ataxia-like symptoms in some people. You may be referred for a series of tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as an infection. The tests will probably include blood and urine tests. ","Further testing":"If your symptoms suggest you may have acquired ataxia because of a serious underlying condition, it's likely you'll be admitted immediately to your nearest hospital. Otherwise, you'll be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in brain and nervous system conditions) for further testing or, in the case of children, a paediatrician. Some of the tests you may have are described below. Genetic testing involves taking a sample of blood and testing the DNA in it for any genetic mutation known to cause ataxia. Currently, tests can detect the mutations responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia and most of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Brain scans can be used to check for physical abnormalities in the brain that could be caused by certain types of hereditary ataxia. They can also be used to check for other problems that may affect your brain, such as a brain tumour. The two most widely used brain imaging scans are: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed scans of the soft tissue of the brain computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken and assembled by a computer into a detailed three-dimensional image of your brain Some of the other tests you may have to help diagnose ataxia and determine how severe it is can include: a lumbar puncture \u2013 where a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is taken from the base of the spine to check it for infection and any other abnormalities nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) \u2013 tests used to assess the electrical activity in nerves and muscles videofluoroscopy \u2013 a continuous moving X-ray taken while you swallow different types of food and drink an electrocardiogram (ECG) \u2013  an assessment of the electrical activity of the heart an echocardiogram \u2013 an ultrasound scan of the heart Page last reviewed: 12/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Ataxia"}},"Adenoids and adenoidectomy":{"Introduction":{" ":"An adenoidectomy is an operation to remove the adenoids. This topic covers: What are adenoids? When adenoids need to be removed How an adenoidectomy is carried out Risks Recovery Adenoids are small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose, above the roof of the mouth. You can't see a person's adenoids by looking in their mouth. Adenoids are part of the immune system, which helps fight infection and protects the body from bacteria and viruses. Only children have adenoids. They start to grow from birth and are at their largest when a child is around three to five years of age. By age seven to eight, the adenoids start to shrink and by the late teens, they're barely visible. By adulthood, they'll have disappeared completely. Adenoids can be helpful in young children, but they're not an essential part of an adult's immune system. This is why they shrink and eventually disappear. A child's adenoids can sometimes become swollen or enlarged. This can happen after a bacterial or viral infection, or after a substance triggers an allergic reaction. In most cases, swollen adenoids only cause mild discomfort and treatment isn't needed. However, for some children, it can cause severe discomfort and interfere with their daily life. Adenoids may need to be removed if your child has: breathing problems \u2013 your child may have difficulty breathing through their nose and may have to breathe through their mouth instead, which can cause problems such as cracked lips and a dry mouth difficulty sleeping \u2013 your child may have problems sleeping and may start to snore; in severe cases, some children may develop sleep apnoea (irregular breathing during sleep and excessive sleepiness during the day) recurrent or persistent problems with the ears \u2013 such as middle ear infections (otitis media) or glue ear (where the middle ear becomes filled with fluid) recurrent or persistent sinusitis \u2013 leading to symptoms such as a constantly runny nose, facial pain and nasal-sounding speech The adenoids can be removed during an adenoidectomy. The operation is usually carried out by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon and takes around 30 minutes. Afterwards, your child will need to stay in the recovery ward for up to an hour until the anaesthetic has worn off. Adenoidectomies are sometimes day cases if carried out in the morning, in which case your child may be able to go home on the same day. However, if the procedure is carried out in the afternoon, your child may need to stay in hospital overnight. ","When to seek medical advice":"Contact your GP immediately or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if your child experiences the following symptoms shortly after surgery: bright red bleeding from their mouth (for more than two minutes) a fever intense pain that isn't reduced by painkillers Some of the possible problems after having an adenoidectomy are outlined below. ","Tonsils":"If your child has large tonsils, or has had severe or frequent bouts of tonsillitis, removing the tonsils and adenoids at the same time may be recommended. This procedure is called an adenotonsillectomy. Removing the adenoids and tonsils in a single procedure reduces the risk of complications. However, adenoidectomies, tonsillectomies and adenotonsillectomies are quick and straightforward procedures with few associated risks. Read more about tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils). ","Pain relief":"Your child may still have a sore throat, earache or stiff jaw after returning home, and they may need painkillers in the days after the operation. Over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, are usually suitable. Younger children may find it easier to take liquid or soluble paracetamol, particularly if they have a sore throat. Always make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the packet, and never give aspirin to a child who's under the age of 16. ","URL":"/conditions/Adenoids-and-adenoidectomy","The procedure":"An adenoidectomy is carried out under general anaesthetic, so your child will be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain. Your child's mouth will be propped open and after the adenoids have been located, the surgeon will remove them by scraping them away with an instrument called a curette, or by applying heat using a diathermy instrument. A diathermy instrument produces high-frequency electrical currents that burn the adenoids. After the adenoids have been removed, the diathermy instrument may be used to stop the bleeding (cauterisation), or a pack made out of gauze may be applied to the skin in the mouth. When this is removed, the operation is complete. ","Bleeding":"In rare cases, excessive bleeding can occur after the adenoids have been removed. This is known as a haemorrhage. Further surgery will be needed for cauterisation (where heat is applied to stop the bleeding) or to insert a dressing. Less than 1 in 100 children need emergency treatment to stop a haemorrhage. However, if it occurs, a haemorrhage needs to be dealt with quickly to prevent excessive blood loss. It's normal to have a sore throat after an adenoidectomy. Your child will usually be given painkillers while in hospital to help ease discomfort. Your child may also feel groggy and sleepy after having an anaesthetic. After the operation, they'll be observed for several hours to make sure they're recovering normally. Once the doctor is satisfied, you'll be able to take your child home. ","Infection":"All surgery carries the risk of infection. The tissue in the area where the adenoids were removed may become infected with bacteria. Therefore, after the procedure, your child may be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent infection. ","Before the operation":"Tell your ENT surgeon if your child has had a cold or sore throat in the week before the operation. If your child has a high temperature and cough, the operation may have to be postponed for a few weeks to ensure they've fully recovered and to reduce their risk of developing complications as a result of the surgery. ","Minor problems after surgery":"After an adenoidectomy, some children experience minor health problems. However, most of these are temporary and rarely require further treatment. They can include: sore throat earache stiff jaw blocked nose or nasal discharge bad breath (halitosis) a change in voice (your child may sound like they're speaking through their nose) Most of these symptoms will pass within one to two weeks, and shouldn't last longer than four weeks. Contact your GP if your child is still experiencing side effects after this time. ","Returning to school":"Your child will need to rest for several days after an adenoidectomy and should be kept off school for a week. This is to reduce their risk of getting an infection. The skin and tissue where the adenoids used to be will take a while to heal. It's important to try to prevent the wound becoming infected because an infection could cause complications. Keep your child away from people with coughs or colds, and from smoky environments. They should also avoid swimming for three weeks after the operation.  Page last reviewed: 29/12/2016 Next review due: 29/12/2019 ","Grommets":"Grommets may be inserted at the same time as an adenoidectomy if your child has had persistent glue ear which affects their hearing. Grommets are tiny tubes that are inserted into the ear through a small incision in the eardrum. They drain fluid away from the middle ear and help maintain air pressure. An adenoidectomy is a low-risk procedure and complications following surgery are rare. However, as with all types of surgery, there are some associated risks. ","Eating and drinking":"Your child should be able to drink liquids two to three hours after having an adenoidectomy. They can begin eating several hours after that. To start with, eating normally may be difficult because of the sore throat. Encourage your child to eat soft or liquid foods, such as soups or yoghurts, which are easier to swallow. Giving your child a dose of painkillers about an hour or so before they eat may make swallowing food easier. It's also important for them to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. ","Allergy to the anaesthetic":"With any surgery where an anaesthetic is required, there's a risk of the person having an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. If your child's general health is good, their risk of having a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the anaesthetic is extremely small (1 in 20,000). Around 1 in 10 children may experience some temporary symptoms, such as a headache, sickness or dizziness.

They may suspect acanthosis nigricans just by looking at your skin. If the cause isn't clear, you may have blood tests to check your blood sugar or hormone levels, and you might need additional tests such as an endoscopy or X-ray. ","What causes acanthosis nigricans?":"Acanthosis nigricans sometimes occurs in people who are otherwise in good health, particularly dark-skinned people of African descent. However, in most cases it's a sign of an underlying problem or condition such as obesity, diabetes or abnormal hormone levels. Some of the main causes of acanthosis nigricans are outlined below. Acanthosis nigricans is usually the result of obesity. This is known as obesity-associated acanthosis nigricans. It occurs because obesity can cause insulin resistance (when the body is unable to properly use the hormone insulin), which may lead to high levels of insulin in the blood, affecting the skin cells. Insulin resistance can also cause type 2 diabetes, so acanthosis nigricans can be an early sign that you have diabetes or are at risk of developing the condition. Acanthosis nigricans is sometimes associated with an underlying syndrome or hormone problem, such as: polycystic ovary syndrome \u2013 a condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work, which can cause excessive body hair, irregular periods, infertility, acne and weight gain Cushing's syndrome \u2013 symptoms such as weight gain, bruising and stretch marks caused by very high levels of the hormone cortisol in the body acromegaly \u2013 where the body produces too much growth hormone, leading to the excess growth of body tissues over time underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) \u2013 where your thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones, causing symptoms such as tiredness and weight gain This type of acanthosis nigricans is known as syndromic acanthosis nigricans. Acanthosis nigricans is sometimes triggered by medicines, including insulin, corticosteroids, and hormone treatments such as human growth hormone or the contraceptive pill. This is known as drug-induced or medication-associated acanthosis nigricans. In rare cases, acanthosis nigricans can be caused by a faulty gene inherited directly from your parents. This is known as familial or benign genetic acanthosis nigricans. This type is usually passed on in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means it can be passed on if only one of your parents carries the faulty gene. If the dark skin patches come on suddenly and spread quickly, it may be a sign you have cancer (usually stomach cancer). This is known as malignant acanthosis nigricans. This is a rare condition that tends to affect middle-aged or elderly people, regardless of their weight or ethnic background. The patches are more severe and the mouth, tongue and lips may also be affected. The skin may also become irritated and itchy. ","Signs and symptoms":"If you have acanthosis nigricans, you'll have thickened, brownish-grey or black patches of skin. The patches will be dry and rough, feeling similar to velvet. They may also be itchy. These patches may occur anywhere, but are usually seen around the neck, in the armpit, around the groin and sometimes in other skin folds. Occasionally, the skin over the joints of the fingers and toes may be affected, as well as the lips, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The patches usually develop slowly over time. Patches that grow and spread quickly are more likely to be associated with cancer. In these cases, the mouth, tongue, throat, nose and windpipe may also be affected.  You may also have lots of tiny finger-like growths from the patches. This is known as papillomatosis. There may also be skin tags around the affected area. These are small flesh-coloured or pigmented growths that hang off the skin and look a bit like warts.  ","Introduction ":"Acanthosis nigricans is the medical term for darkened, thickened patches of skin that usually develop in the armpit and around the groin and neck. It's not a condition in itself, but can be a sign of an underlying health problem. These underlying conditions aren't usually serious, although occasionally acanthosis nigricans can be sign of cancer. ","Outlook":"Most cases of acanthosis nigricans are harmless and not a sign of anything serious. The skin patches often fade with time as the underlying condition is treated. If you have inherited acanthosis nigricans from your parents, your patches may gradually get bigger before staying the same or eventually fading on their own. Only in cases where there is underlying cancer is the situation very serious. If the tumour is successfully treated, the condition may disappear, but unfortunately the types of cancer that cause acanthosis nigricans tend to spread quickly and a cure is often not possible. Page last reviewed: 14/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","How acanthosis nigricans is treated":"Treatment for acanthosis nigricans aims to correct the underlying cause of your symptoms. This will usually cure the acanthosis nigricans or significantly improve the appearance of your skin. Treatments that may be recommended include: losing weight, making changes to your diet and taking medication to reduce the level of insulin in your blood taking medication to correct your hormone levels \u2013 read about treating Cushing's syndrome, treating polycystic ovary syndrome and treating an underactive thyroid switching to a different medication if it's triggering your symptoms surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy for cancer There's no specific treatment to get rid of the patches, but a dermatologist (skin specialist) may be able to recommend treatments such as creams or tablets that may help improve the look of your skin.

The test will only be done if the benefits of having the procedure are felt to outweigh any potential risk. Speak to your doctor about the risks involved with having an angiogram. After an angiogram, many people have: bruising soreness a very small bump or collection of blood near where the cut was made These problems should improve in a few days or weeks and aren't usually anything to worry about. You can take painkillers such as paracetamol for any discomfort if you need to. Most people who have an angiogram won't experience any complications, but there is a small chance of minor or serious complications occurring. Possible minor complications include: an infection where the cut was made, causing the area to become red, hot, swollen and painful \u2013 this may need to be treated with antibiotics a mild reaction to the dye, such as an itchy rash \u2013 this can usually be controlled with medication Possible serious complications include: kidney damage due to the dye \u2013 this is usually temporary a heart attack or stroke damage to a blood vessel, causing internal bleeding \u2013 further surgery may be needed to repair the damage  a serious allergic reaction to the dye (anaphylaxis), causing dizziness, breathing difficulties or loss of consciousness These serious complications are very rare.

Blood vessels don't show up clearly on a normal X-ray, so a special dye needs to be injected into your blood first. This highlights your blood vessels, allowing your doctor to spot any problems. The X-ray images created during angiography are called \"angiograms\". This page covers: Why angiograms are used What happens Risks and complications Types of angiogram Angiography is used to check the health of your blood vessels and how blood flows through them. It can be used to help diagnose or investigate a number of problems affecting the blood vessels, including: atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries), which could mean you're at risk of having a stroke or heart attack peripheral arterial disease (reduced blood supply to the leg muscles) a brain aneurysm (a bulge in a blood vessel in your brain) angina (chest pain that occurs when the blood supply to the heart muscle is restricted) blood clots or a pulmonary embolism (a blockage in the artery supplying your lungs) a blockage in the blood supply to your kidneys Angiography may also be used to help plan treatment for some of these conditions. Angiography is carried out in a hospital X-ray or radiology department.

This is known as angioplasty. Once the procedure is finished, the catheter is removed and pressure is placed on the cut to stop any bleeding. Stitches aren't needed. After the test, you'll be taken to a recovery ward where you'll be asked to lie still for a few hours to prevent bleeding from the cut. You'll usually be able to go home the same day, although sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight. It may be possible to tell you the results of the test before you go home, but often the X-rays need to be studied in detail and the results are not available for a few weeks. While recovering at home: rest for the remainder of the day \u2013 it's a good idea for someone to stay with you for at least 24 hours in case you have any problems eat and drink as soon as you feel ready to \u2013 the contrast dye leaves your body in your urine, so drinking plenty of water can help flush it out faster you can usually return to most normal activities the next day, although you may need to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous exercise for a few days  You will probably have some bruising and soreness for at least a few days.

Participation in research is important and helps to improve dementia care and support for people with dementia, plus their carers and families. You can read about ongoing dementia research on the Alzheimer's Research UK website. You can also ask your local memory clinic about projects taking place. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has advised that there isn't evidence to support the use of the following to prevent dementia: statins hormone replacement therapy \u2013 when chemicals are taken to replace those that your body no longer produces vitamin E \u2013 found in a variety of foods, such as olive oil, nuts and seeds non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page last reviewed: 17/03/2016 Next review due: 17/03/2018 ","Reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease":"Cardiovascular disease has been linked with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. You may be able to reduce your risk of developing these conditions \u2013 as well as other serious problems, such as strokes and heart attacks \u2013 by taking steps to improve your cardiovascular health, including:  stopping smoking not drinking large amounts of alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet, including at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day exercising for at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) every week by doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) \u2013 this will improve both your physical and mental health make sure your blood pressure is checked and controlled through regular health tests if you have diabetes, make sure you keep to the diet and take your medication Read more about preventing dementia. ","Preventing Alzheimer's disease ":"As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, there's no way to prevent the condition. However, there are steps you can take that may help to delay the onset of dementia. ","Staying mentally active":"There's some evidence to suggest that rates of dementia are lower in people who remain as mentally, physically and socially active as possible throughout their lives, as well as among those who enjoy a wide range of different activities and hobbies. It may be possible to reduce your risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia by: reading writing for pleasure learning foreign languages playing musical instruments taking part in adult education courses playing tennis playing golf swimming group sports, such as bowling walking Interventions such as \"brain training\" computer games have been shown to improve cognition over a short period, but research hasn't yet demonstrated whether this can prevent dementia. ","URL":"/conditions/Alzheimers-disease"},"Treatment":{"Supportive measures and treatments":"In addition to medication, treatment for Alzheimer's disease involves a wide range of other measures and treatments to help people with dementia live as independently as possible. For example, an occupational therapist can identify problems or unsafe areas in your everyday life and help you to develop strategies or use alternative tools to manage these. They may suggest: ways of prompting and reminding yourself of important tasks \u2013 such as using diaries or calendars assistive technology \u2013 devices or systems to help maintain the independence and safety of people living with dementia adding grab bars and handrails to your home to help you move around safely other professionals visiting you at home and assisting with daily tasks to maintain your independence in the community Psychological treatments, such as cognitive stimulation, may be offered to help improve your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Medication, other psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, music and art therapy, reminiscence and relaxation therapies may also be offered. These may help with managing depression, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and challenging behaviour that can occur with Alzheimer's disease. Read more about how dementia is treated. ","Advice for carers":"In England, the Care Act now requires local authorities to assess carer\u2019s support needs and, if they're eligible, to provide support. This should be discussed with you when you're assessed at your local memory service or via your GP. Carers can find information about: respite care \u2013 which can allow you to take breaks from caring personal and household finance \u2013 including information about council tax discounts and budgeting advice benefits for carers \u2013 such as allowances and tax credits that may be available  getting legal help \u2013 if you're having trouble claiming the right benefits or find it challenging to manage looking after someone with dementia \u2013 including structured carer therapies available in some areas, which can help you develop strategies to manage your own stress ","Medication":"A number of medications may be prescribed for Alzheimer's disease to help temporarily improve some symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine (known as AChE inhibitors) can be prescribed for people with early to mid-stage Alzheimer's disease. Memantine may be prescribed for people with mid-stage disease who cannot take AChE inhibitors, or for those with late-stage disease. There's no difference in how well each of the three different AChE inhibitors work, although some people respond better to certain types or have fewer side effects. All of these medications can only be prescribed by specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists and geriatricians. They may be prescribed by your GP on the advice of a specialist. If you're caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease, your views should be taken into account when prescribing medication, as well as at regular assessments. These assessments take place to ensure the medication is having a worthwhile effect and to identify and monitor side effects. Read guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine can cause side effects such as: feeling and being sick dizziness diarrhoea  headache  agitation insomnia muscle cramps more rarely, slowing of the heartbeat \u2013 which can cause issues if you already have problems with your heart rhythm. These side effects are more likely to occur at the beginning of therapy or when the dose is increased. Your doctor should review your medical history and your other medications to check the suitability and risk of interactions. Common side effects of memantine include: dizziness headaches high blood pressure tiredness constipation shortness of breath more rarely, problems with walking or increased confusion very rarely, seizures For more information about the possible side effects of your specific medication, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor. ","Palliative care":"Although the outlook is variable, dementia is a life-limiting illness and can begin to affect multiple body systems in the later stages. End of life care, or palliative care, provides support for people with an incurable illness, so they're able to live as well and as comfortably as possible until their death. It also involves support for family members. Care may be provided at home, a hospice, a care home or hospital. For people nearing the end of life, their care team should assess their needs, make them feel comfortable and allow them to die with dignity in a place of their choosing. Read more about palliative care for dementia. ","Driving":"A diagnosis of dementia doesn't necessarily mean you need to stop driving immediately. However, you must inform the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You should also let your car insurance company know. Your memory clinic can tell you about driving assessments and what reports are needed. Read more about dementia and driving on GOV.UK. Page last reviewed: 17/03/2016 Next review due: 17/03/2018 ","Care plan":"If you're diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, it's helpful if your health and social care needs are assessed and plans made for the future. A care plan is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as: what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in whether you need any financial assistance Healthcare professionals (such as your GP or psychiatrist) and social care services (which is normally your local council working with the NHS), will usually both be involved in helping draw up and carry out care plans. Read more about care plans for long-term conditions. ","Advance care planning":"People with dementia often live for many years after their diagnosis. However, as it's a progressive condition, it can be helpful and reassuring for both you and your family if you make plans for the future. Advance care planning means considering, discussing and possibly recording your wishes and decisions for future care. It's about planning for a time when you may not be able to make some decisions for yourself. In the earlier stages of the disease, you should have the opportunity to discuss with health professionals and your family about the future. This may involve the use of: advance statements  advance decisions to refuse treatment lasting power of attorney preferred priorities for care Read more about advance care planning. ","Practical tips for people with Alzheimer's":"If you have Alzheimer's disease, you may find it useful to: keep a diary and write down things you want to remember pin a weekly timetable to the wall put your keys in an obvious place, such as in a large bowl in your living room have a daily newspaper delivered to remind you of the day and date put labels on cupboards and drawers keep useful telephone numbers by the phone write yourself reminders \u2013 for example, put a note on the front door to remind you to take your keys with you if you go out programme people's names and numbers into your telephone set the alarm on your watch to act as a reminder install safety devices such as gas detectors and smoke alarms throughout your home It may also be helpful to get in touch with a local or national Alzheimer's or dementia support group, such as the Alzheimer's Society, for more information and advice about living with Alzheimer's disease.

Support is also available to help someone with the condition cope with everyday life. "},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 850,000 people in the UK. Dementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition previous severe head injuries lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease It's becoming increasingly understood that it's very common to have both changes of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia). Read more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease. ","Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease":"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. ","Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented?":"As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health. Read more about preventing Alzheimer's disease. Page last reviewed: 17/03/2016 Next review due: 17/03/2018 ","Outlook":"On average, people with Alzheimer's disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not. Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.  There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease need palliative care. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. ","How Alzheimer's disease is treated":"There's no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease. ","Receiving a diagnosis":"As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. However, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to:   discuss the process of making the diagnosis organise testing  create a treatment plan   Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. ","Who is affected?":"Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. However, around 1 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer's disease affects people aged 40 to 65. ","URL":"/conditions/Alzheimers-disease"},"Causes":{"Causes of Alzheimer's disease ":"Alzheimer's disease is caused by parts of the brain shrinking (atrophy), which affects the structure and function of particular brain areas. It's not known exactly what causes this process to begin. However, in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, scientists have found amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine. It's also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain. These reduce the effectiveness of healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them. Over time, this damage spreads to several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories. ","Increased risk":"Although it's still unknown what triggers Alzheimer's disease, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition. Age is the single most significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age. However, it's not just older people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Around 1 in 20 people with the condition are under 65. This is called early onset Alzheimer's disease and it can affect people from around the age of 40. The genes you inherit from your parents can contribute to your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a close family member with the condition. However, in a few families, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition being passed on are much higher. If several of your family members have developed dementia over the generations, it may be appropriate to seek genetic counselling for information and advice about your chances of developing Alzheimer's disease when you are older. The Alzheimer's Society website has more information about the genetics of dementia. People with Down's syndrome are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This is because the genetic fault that causes Down's syndrome can also cause amyloid plaques to build up in the brain over time, which can lead to Alzheimer's disease in some people. People who have had a severe head injury have been found to be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Research shows that several lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. These include: smoking obesity  diabetes  high blood pressure high cholesterol You can help reduce your risk by: stopping smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet leading an active life, both physically and mentally losing weight if you need to drinking less alcohol having regular health checks as you get older Read more about reducing your risk of Alzheimer's disease.

If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going with them. It's often very helpful having a friend or family member there. A timely diagnosis gives you the best chance to adjust, prepare and plan for the future, as well as accessing treatments and support that may help. ","Referral to a specialist":"Your GP may refer you to a specialist memory assessment service to help with your diagnosis. Memory clinics are staffed by professionals from multiple disciplines who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families. Memory clinic staff can include the following, depending on your local area: a nurse \u2013 usually a trained mental health nurse who specialises in diagnosing and caring for people with dementia a psychologist \u2013 a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions a psychiatrist \u2013 a qualified medical doctor who has training in treating mental health conditions a neurologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) a geriatrician \u2013 a physician with specialist training in the care of older people a social worker \u2013 a trained member of staff able to advise and assist with accessing social services within the local area an occupational therapist \u2013 a member of staff with specialist skills in assessing and supporting people with dementia and their families with adjusting to disabilities There's no simple and reliable test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, but the staff will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking. They will assess your skills and arrange more tests to rule out other conditions. A specialist will usually assess your mental abilities using a special series of questions. One widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). This involves being asked to carry out activities such as memorising a short list of objects correctly and identifying the current day of the week, month and year. Different memory clinics may also use other, longer tests.  The MMSE isn't used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, but it's useful to initially assess areas of difficulty that a person with the condition may have. This helps specialists to make decisions about treatment and whether more tests are necessary. To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by Alzheimer's disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan. This could be a: computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 where several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer is used to put the images together magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of your brain Read more about tests for diagnosing dementia.  Some specialist centres offer scans which look at brain function and particular protein deposits. However, at the moment, these are mostly experimental and only used if the diagnosis is unclear.  ","After diagnosis":"It may take several appointments and tests over months, or even years, before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be confirmed. For some people, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a huge shock, especially as it's not unusual for people with dementia to have less awareness of their difficulties. For others, the diagnosis can be very important in helping them and their families to make sense of symptoms they've been concerned about for a long time. If you've just been given a diagnosis of dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. It may be helpful to have the diagnosis explained again to help make sense of the idea over time. It might help to talk things through with family and friends, and to seek support from the Alzheimer's Society. It takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family. Some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news. However, as dementia is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis is often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future.

Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary. Your GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed. They'll also check other aspects of your health, and carry out a physical examination. They may also organise some blood tests and ask about any medication you're taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. You'll usually be asked some questions and carry out some memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning. This can help your GP decide if you need to be referred to a specialist for more assessments. "},"Symptoms":{"Stages of Alzheimer's disease":"Generally, the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are divided into three main stages. In the early stages, the main symptom of Alzheimer's disease is memory lapses. For example, someone with early Alzheimer's disease may: forget about recent conversations or events, or misplace items forget the names of places and objects, or have trouble thinking of the right word repeat themselves regularly, such as asking the same question several times show poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions become less flexible and more hesitant to try new things There are often signs of mood changes, such as increasing anxiety or agitation, or periods of confusion. As Alzheimer's disease develops, memory problems will get worse. Someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends. Other symptoms may also develop, such as: increasing confusion and disorientation \u2013 for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is obsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour delusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members problems with speech or language (aphasia) disturbed sleep changes in mood, such as frequent mood swings, depression and feeling increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated difficulty performing spatial tasks, such as judging distances hallucinations By this stage, someone with Alzheimer's disease usually needs support to help them with their everyday living. For example, they may need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet. In the later stages of Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family. Hallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get worse as the condition progresses. Sometimes people with Alzheimer's disease can be violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them. A number of other symptoms may also develop as Alzheimer's disease progresses, such as: difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia) difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance considerable weight loss \u2013 although some people eat too much and put on weight unintentional passing of urine (urinary incontinence) or stools (bowel incontinence) gradual loss of speech significant problems with short- and long-term memory In the severe stages of Alzheimer's disease, people may need full-time care and assistance with eating, moving and using the toilet.

If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. Memory problems are not just caused by dementia \u2013 they can also be caused by depression, stress, medications or other health problems. Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary. Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.

Sometimes these symptoms are confused with other conditions and may initially be put down to old age. The rate at which the symptoms progress is different for each individual and it's not possible to predict exactly how quickly it will get worse. In some cases, infections, medications, strokes or delirium can be responsible for symptoms getting worse. Anyone with Alzheimer's disease whose symptoms are rapidly getting worse should be seen by a doctor, so these can be managed. "}},"Amniotic fluid, excess":{"Introduction":{" ":"Polyhydramnios is where there is too much amniotic fluid around the baby during pregnancy. Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds your baby in the womb. Too much amniotic fluid is normally spotted during a check-up in the later stages of pregnancy. It isn't usually a sign of anything serious, but you'll probably have some extra check-ups and will be advised to give birth in hospital. This page covers: Will I have a healthy pregnancy and baby? Symptoms of polyhydramnios Tests, checks and treatments you may have Things you can do Your labour and giving birth Causes of polyhydramnios Most women with polyhydramnios won't have any significant problems during their pregnancy and will have a healthy baby. But there is a slightly increased risk of: pregnancy and birth complications, such as giving birth prematurely (before 37 weeks), problems with the baby's position or a problem with the position of the umbilical cord (prolapsed umbilical cord) a problem with your baby \u2013 read about the causes of polyhydramnios for more information You'll need extra check-ups to look for these problems and you'll normally be advised to give birth in hospital. Polyhydramnios tends to develop gradually and there may not be noticeable symptoms. Some women experience: breathlessness swollen feet heartburn constipation feeling your bump is very big and heavy But these are common problems for pregnant women and aren't necessarily caused by polyhydramnios. Talk to your midwife if you have these symptoms and you're worried. In rare cases, fluid can build up around the baby quickly. Contact your midwife or doctor if your tummy gets bigger suddenly. During the rest of your pregnancy, you'll probably have: extra antenatal appointments and ultrasound scans to check for problems with you and your baby tests to look for causes of polyhydramnios, such as a blood test for diabetes in pregnancy or amniocentesis (where some amniotic fluid is removed and tested) treatment for the underlying cause, if one is found \u2013 for example, changes to your diet or possibly medication if you have diabetes Sometimes you may need treatment to reduce the amount of fluid. Some may be drained with a needle or you may be given medication to help stop more fluid being produced. Your midwife or doctor may also talk to you about any changes to your birth plan. See labour and giving birth if you have polyhydramnios for more about what to expect. If you've been told you have polyhydramnios: try not to worry - remember polyhydramnios isn't usually a sign of something serious get plenty of rest \u2013 if you work, you might consider starting your maternity leave early speak to your doctor or midwife about your birth plan \u2013 including what to do if your waters break or labour starts earlier than expected talk to your midwife or doctor if you have any concerns about yourself or your baby, you get any new symptoms, you feel very uncomfortable, or your tummy gets bigger suddenly You may find it useful to speak to other women who've had polyhydramnios. You could try joining an online forum such as the NCT HealthUnlocked forum. You'll normally be advised to give birth in hospital. This is so that any equipment or treatment needed for you or your baby is easily available. You can usually wait for labour to start naturally. Sometimes induction (starting labour with medication) or a caesarean section (an operation to deliver your baby) may be needed if there's a risk to you or your baby. You'll probably pass a lot of fluid when you give birth \u2013 this is normal and nothing to worry about. Your baby's heartbeat may also need to be monitored during labour. After giving birth, your baby will have an examination to check they're healthy and they may have some tests \u2013 for example, a tube may be passed down their throat to check for a problem with their gut. It's often unclear why too much fluid sometimes builds up during pregnancy, but it can be due to: a twin or multiple pregnancy diabetes in the mother \u2013 including diabetes caused by pregnancy (gestational diabetes) a blockage in the baby's gut (gut atresia) a problem with the placenta the baby's blood cells being attacked by the mother's blood cells (rhesus disease) a build-up of fluid in the baby (hydrops fetalis) a genetic problem in the baby Most babies whose mothers have polyhydramnios will be healthy.

It's usually caused by an infection near the anus resulting in a collection of pus (an abscess). Symptoms of an anal fistula or abscess can include: a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down skin irritation around the anus passing pus or blood when you poo swelling and redness around your anus a high temperature (fever) Your GP may prescribe antibiotics if an abscess is picked up early on. If it persists, it may need to be drained in hospital, possibly under general anaesthetic (while you're asleep). If a fistula develops, surgery will usually be needed because they rarely heal by themselves. Read more about treatments for anal fistulas. Less common causes of anal pain include: proctalgia fugax \u2013 a condition that causes episodes of sudden, severe anal pain that last for a few minutes at a time; medication that relaxes the muscles in the pelvis may help levator ani syndrome \u2013 an aching or pressure sensation in and around the anus that may be constant or last for hours or days at a time; treatment to relax the muscles in the pelvis may help an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease \u2013 other symptoms can include tummy cramps, bloody diarrhoea and weight loss; treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms an infection \u2013 such as a fungal infection or rectal sexually transmitted infection (STI) a bone-related problem \u2013 such as coccydynia (tailbone pain) or pain that spreads from your lower back, pelvis or hips, caused by arthritis or bone tumours a urinary tract problem \u2013 such as prostatitis (inflammation or infection of the prostate gland) cancer of the anus or lower rectum \u2013 this can have similar symptoms of haemorrhoids and anal fissures, but is much rarer  Many common causes of anal pain will improve with simple self-care treatments, so you don't always need to see your GP. But it's a good idea to see your GP if: your pain is severe your pain doesn't improve after a few days you also experience rectal bleeding Don't feel embarrassed to see your GP \u2013 anal pain is a common problem that they're used to seeing. Your GP can try to work out what the problem is and give you treatment advice. They'll probably ask to see your bottom and may carry out a rectal examination (where they gently insert a gloved finger into your bottom) to check for any abnormalities. If the cause is not immediately obvious, they may refer you to a specialist for advice and further tests.

They're often thought to be caused by straining on the toilet as a result of prolonged constipation. In many cases, haemorrhoids don't cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include: bleeding after doing a poo an itchy bottom feeling like there's a lump in or around your anus soreness and redness around your anus anal pain, if the blood supply to the haemorrhoid becomes blocked or interrupted \u2013 for example, by a blood clot The symptoms often pass after a few days. Increasing the amount of fibre in your diet, drinking plenty of fluids and taking laxatives and over-the-counter painkillers can help. If the blood supply to the haemorrhoid has been blocked by a clot, a simple procedure can be carried out to remove the clot under local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed).

This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. ","More information":"Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. ","Lifestyle changes":"If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  ","Medication":"Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure ","Hospital procedures":"In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  "},"Title":"Cardiomyopathy"},"Agoraphobia":{"Treatment":{" ":"A stepwise approach is usually recommended for treating agoraphobia and any underlying panic disorder. The steps are as follows: step one \u2013 find out more about your condition, the lifestyle changes you can make, and self-help techniques to help relieve symptoms step two \u2013 enrol yourself on a guided self-help programme step three \u2013 undertake more intensive treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), or see if your symptoms can be controlled using medication The various treatments for agoraphobia are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the different treatments for agoraphobia, allowing you to compare your treatment options. Learning more about agoraphobia and its association with panic disorder and panic attacks may help you control your symptoms better. For example, there are techniques you can use during a panic attack to bring your emotions under control.  Having more confidence in controlling your emotions may make you more confident coping with previously uncomfortable situations and environments. These self-help techniques are described below. stay where you are \u2013 try to resist the urge to run to a place of safety during a panic attack; if you're driving, pull over and park where it's safe to do so focus \u2013 it's important for you to focus on something non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch, or items in a supermarket; remind yourself the frightening thoughts and sensations are a sign of panic and will eventually pass breathe slowly and deeply \u2013 feelings of panic and anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly; try to focus on slow, deep breathing while counting slowly to three on each breath in and out challenge your fear \u2013 try to work out what it is you fear and challenge it; you can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn't real and will pass creative visualisation \u2013 during a panic attack, try to resist the urge to think negative thoughts, such as \"disaster\"; instead, think of a place or situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease: once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it don't fight an attack \u2013 trying to fight the symptoms of a panic attack can often make things worse; instead, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack isn't life threatening Making some lifestyle changes can also help. For example, ensure you: take regular exercise \u2013 exercise can help relieve stress and tension and improve your mood have a healthy diet \u2013 a poor diet can make the symptoms of panic and anxiety worse avoid using drugs and alcohol \u2013 they may provide short-term relief, but in the long term they can make symptoms worse avoid drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee or cola \u2013 caffeine has a stimulant effect and can make your symptoms worse If your symptoms don't respond to these self-help techniques and lifestyle changes, your GP may recommend enrolling on a guided self-help programme. This involves working through self-help manuals that cover the types of issues you might be facing, along with practical advice about how to deal with them. A number of internet-based programmes are also available. For example, Moodjuice is an online resource designed to help you think about emotional problems and work towards resolving them. Guided self-help for agoraphobia is based on CBT, which aims to change unhelpful and unrealistic patterns of thinking to bring about positive changes in behaviour. In turn, CBT uses a type of therapy called exposure therapy, which involves being gradually exposed to the object or situation you fear and using relaxation techniques and breathing exercises to help reduce your anxiety. As part of the programme, you may have brief sessions with a CBT therapist \u2013 around 20 to 30 minutes long \u2013 over the telephone or face to face. You may also be invited to take part in group work with other people with a history of agoraphobia and panic disorders. Most self-help programmes consist of a series of goals to work towards over the course of five to six weeks. If the self-help programme hasn't worked, you may be referred for more intensive therapies. There are three main options: CBT with a therapist  applied relaxation medication ","Medication":"In some cases, medication can be used as a sole treatment for agoraphobia. In more severe cases, it can also be used in combination with CBT or applied relaxation therapy. If medication is recommended for you, you'll usually be prescribed a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs were originally developed to treat depression, but they've subsequently proved effective for helping treat other mood disorders, such as anxiety, feelings of panic, and obsessional thoughts. An SSRI called sertraline is usually recommended for people with agoraphobia. Side effects associated with sertraline include: feeling sick loss of sex drive (libido) blurred vision diarrhoea or constipation feeling agitated or shaky excessive sweating  These side effects should improve over time, although some can occasionally persist. If sertraline fails to improve your symptoms, you may be prescribed an alternative SSRI or a similar type of medication known as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The length of time you'll have to take an SSRI or SNRI for will vary depending on your response to treatment. Some people may have to take SSRIs for 6 to 12 months or more. When you and your GP decide it's appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you'll be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. You should never stop taking your medication unless your GP specifically advises you to. If you're unable to take SSRIs or SNRIs for medical reasons or you experience troublesome side effects, another medication called pregabalin may be recommended. Dizziness and drowsiness are common side effects of pregabalin. If you experience a particularly severe flare-up of panic-related symptoms, you may be prescribed a short course of benzodiazepines. These are tranquillisers designed to reduce anxiety and promote calmness and relaxation. Taking benzodiazepines for longer than two weeks in a row isn't usually recommended as they can become addictive. ","Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)":"Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour. CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave more positively. For example, many people with agoraphobia have the unrealistic thought that if they have a panic attack it will kill them. The CBT therapist will try to encourage a more positive way of thinking \u2013 for example, although having a panic attack may be unpleasant, it isn't fatal and will pass. This shift in thinking can lead to more positive behaviour in terms of a person being more willing to confront situations that previously scared them. CBT is usually combined with exposure therapy. Your therapist will set relatively modest goals at the start of treatment, such as going to your local corner shop. As you become more confident, more challenging goals can be set, such as going to a large supermarket or having a meal in a busy restaurant. A course of CBT usually consists of 12 to 15 weekly sessions, with each session lasting about an hour. ","Support groups":"Charities like Anxiety Alliance and Anxiety Care UK are useful resources for information and advice about how to effectively manage anxiety and phobias. They can also put you in touch with other people who've had similar experiences. Anxiety Alliance runs a helpline available on 0845 296 7877, every day from 10am to 10pm.

The aim of applied relaxation is therefore to teach you how to relax. This is achieved using a series of exercises designed to teach you how to: spot the signs and feelings of tension relax your muscles to relieve tension use these techniques in stressful or everyday situations to prevent you feeling tense and panicky As with CBT, a course of applied relaxation therapy consists of 12 to 15 weekly sessions, with each one lasting about an hour.

Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition. Someone with agoraphobia may be scared of: travelling on public transport visiting a shopping centre leaving home If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they'll usually experience the symptoms of a panic attack, such as: rapid heartbeat rapid breathing (hyperventilating) feeling hot and sweaty feeling sick They'll avoid situations that cause anxiety and may only leave the house with a friend or partner. They'll order groceries online rather than going to the supermarket. This change in behaviour is known as avoidance. Read more about the symptoms of agoraphobia. Agoraphobia usually develops as a complication of panic disorder, an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks and moments of intense fear. It can arise by associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them. A minority of people with agoraphobia have no history of panic attacks. In these cases, their fear may be related to issues like a fear of crime, terrorism, illness, or being in an accident. Traumatic events, such as bereavement, may contribute towards agoraphobia, as well as certain genes inherited from your parents. Read more about the possible causes of agoraphobia. Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia. It should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation if you don't feel ready to visit your GP in person. Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations. It's very important you tell them how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you. Your GP may ask you the following questions: Do you find leaving the house stressful? Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid? Do you have any avoidance strategies to help you cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you? It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions, and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment. Read more about diagnosing agoraphobia. With psychological treatment (talking therapies), most people with agoraphobia will make significant improvements, particularly if the three steps described below are followed. A stepwise approach is usually recommended for treating agoraphobia and any underlying panic disorder: step one \u2013 educate yourself about your condition, possible lifestyle changes you can make, and self-help techniques to help relieve symptoms step two \u2013 enrol yourself on a guided self-help programme step three \u2013 more intensive treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or medication Lifestyle changes may include taking regular exercise, eating more healthily, and avoiding alcohol, drugs and drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. Self-help techniques that can help during a panic attack include staying where you are, focusing on something that's non-threatening and visible, and slow, deep breathing. If your agoraphobia fails to respond to these treatment methods, your GP may suggest trying a guided self-help programme.

Around a third of people with agoraphobia eventually achieve a complete cure and remain free from symptoms. Around half experience an improvement in symptoms, but they may have periods when their symptoms become more troublesome \u2013 for example, if they feel stressed. Despite treatment, about one in five people with agoraphobia continue to experience troublesome symptoms.  ","How common is agoraphobia?":"In the UK, up to 2 people in 100 have panic disorder. It's thought around a third will go on to develop agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women as men. It usually starts between the ages of 18 and 35. Page last reviewed: 20/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Agoraphobia"},"Causes":{" ":"Most cases of agoraphobia develop as a complication of panic disorder. Agoraphobia can sometimes develop if a person has a panic attack in a specific situation or environment. They begin to worry so much about having another panic attack that they feel the symptoms of a panic attack returning when they're in a similar situation or environment. This causes the person to avoid that particular situation or environment. As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood. However, most experts think a combination of biological and psychological factors may be involved. ","Psychological factors":"Psychological factors that increase your risk of developing agoraphobia include:  a traumatic childhood experience, such as the death of a parent or being sexually abused experiencing a stressful event, such as bereavement, divorce, or losing your job  a previous history of mental illnesses, such as depression, anorexia nervosa, or bulimia alcohol misuse or drug misuse being in an unhappy relationship, or in a relationship where your partner is very controlling ","Agoraphobia without panic disorder":"Occasionally, a person can develop symptoms of agoraphobia even though they don't have a history of panic disorder or panic attacks. This type of agoraphobia can be triggered by a number of different irrational fears (phobias), such as the fear of: being a victim of violent crime or a terrorist attack if you leave your house becoming infected by a serious illness if you visit crowded places doing something by accident that will result in you embarrassing or humiliating yourself in front of others Page last reviewed: 20/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Agoraphobia","Biological factors":"There are a number of theories about the type of biological factors that may be involved with panic disorders. These are outlined below. One theory is panic disorder is closely associated with your body's natural \"fight or flight\" reflex \u2013 its way of protecting you from stressful and dangerous situations. Anxiety and fear cause your body to release hormones, such as adrenaline, and your breathing and heart rate are increased. This is your body's natural way of preparing itself for a dangerous or stressful situation. In people with panic disorder, it's thought the fight or flight reflex may be triggered wrongly, resulting in a panic attack. Another theory is an imbalance in levels of neurotransmitters in the brain can affect mood and behaviour. This can lead to a heightened stress response in certain situations, triggering the feelings of panic. The \"fear network\" theory suggests the brains of people with panic disorders may be wired differently from most people. There may be a malfunction in parts of the brain known to generate both the emotion of fear and the corresponding physical effect fear can bring. They may be generating strong emotions of fear that trigger a panic attack. Links have been found between panic disorders and spatial awareness. Spatial awareness is the ability to judge where you are in relation to other objects and people. Some people with panic disorder have a weakened balance system and awareness of space. This can cause them to feel overwhelmed and disorientated in crowded places, triggering a panic attack. "},"Title":"Agoraphobia","Diagnosis":{" ":"Speak to your GP if you think you have agoraphobia.

It can be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment. Your GP may want to do a physical examination, and in some cases they may decide to carry out blood tests to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. For example, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause symptoms that are similar to the symptoms of a panic attack.

The symptoms of agoraphobia can be broadly classified into three types: physical cognitive behavioural These are explained in more detail below. The physical symptoms of agoraphobia usually only occur when you find yourself in a situation or environment that causes anxiety. However, many people with agoraphobia rarely experience physical symptoms because they deliberately avoid situations that make them anxious.

It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure. AKI normally happens as a complication of another serious illness. It's not the result of a physical blow to the kidneys, as the name might suggest. This type of kidney damage is usually seen in older people who are unwell with other conditions and the kidneys are also affected. Read more about who's at risk of AKI. It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly. The role of the kidneys is to: filter \u2013 removing waste and water from the blood (as urine, via the bladder) clean the blood keep the bones healthy look after blood pressure stimulate the bone marrow to make blood Without quick treatment, abnormal levels of salts and chemicals can build up in the body, which affects the ability of other organs to work properly.  If the kidneys shut down completely, this may require temporary support from a dialysis machine, or lead to death. In the early stages of AKI, there may not be any symptoms. The only possible warning sign may be that the person isn't producing much urine, although this isn't always the case. However, someone with AKI can deteriorate quickly and suddenly experience any of the following: nausea and vomiting dehydration confusion high blood pressure abdominal pain slight backache a build-up of fluid in the body (oedema) Even if it doesn't progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously. It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some drugs are handled by the body and could make some existing illnesses more serious. AKI is different to chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys gradually lose function over a long period of time. You're more likely to get AKI if: you're aged 65 or over you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure, liver disease or diabetes you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this) you have a severe infection or sepsis you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen) or blood pressure drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics are usually beneficial to the kidneys, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness you're given aminoglycosides \u2013 a type of antibiotic; again, this is only an issue if the person is dehydrated or ill, and these are usually only given in a hospital setting AKI is estimated to affect 13-18% of people admitted to hospital. It can affect both adults and children. Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who is already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by: low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or as seen with severe dehydration the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure, liver failure or sepsis, for example problems with the blood vessels \u2013 such as inflammation and blockage in the blood vessels within the kidneys (a rare condition called vasculitis) certain medicines (see above), which can affect the blood supply to the kidney \u2013 other medicines may cause unusual reactions in the kidney itself AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as glomerulonephritis. This may be caused by a reaction to some drugs, infections or contrast medium (the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays). It may also be due to a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as: an enlarged prostate a tumour in the pelvis \u2013 such as an ovarian or bladder tumour kidney stones A doctor may suspect AKI in people known to be at risk who suddenly fall ill or develop symptoms which suggest complications of AKI. AKI may also be suspected in people who have been unwell for a while and have either: chronic kidney disease  a urinary system disease new or worsening urinary symptoms symptoms or signs of a disease affecting the kidneys and other organs AKI can be diagnosed after measuring urine output and doing blood tests. Blood levels of creatinine \u2013 a chemical waste product produced by the muscles \u2013 will be measured. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine and other waste products from the blood and these are excreted, in the form of urine. It's an easy and quick marker of kidney function, with higher levels of creatinine in the blood indicating poorer kidney function. In adults, a diagnosis of AKI can be made if: blood creatinine level has risen from the baseline value for that person (by 26 micromoles per litre or more within 48 hours) blood creatinine level has risen over time (by 50% or more within the past 7 days) they are passing much less urine (less than 0.5ml per kg per hour for more than 6 hours) In children and teenagers, doctors should use the plasma creatinine level to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A diagnosis of AKI is made if they have a 25% or greater fall in eGFR within the past 7 days. Read more about AKI in children. ","Investigating the underlying cause":"Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause. Doctors also need to know about: any other symptoms \u2013 such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure any other medical conditions any medication that's been taken in the past week \u2013 as some medicines can cause AKI An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour. Treatment of AKI depends on the underlying cause and extent of illness. In most cases, treating the underlying problem will cure the AKI. GPs may be able to manage mild cases in people who aren't already in hospital. They may: advise stopping any medication that may be causing the situation, or making it worse \u2013 it may be safe to resume some of these when the problem is sorted treat any underlying infections advise on fluid intake to prevent dehydration (which could cause or worsen AKI) take blood tests to monitor levels of creatinine and salt \u2013 to check how well a person is recovering refer to a urologist (genitourinary surgeon) or nephrologist (kidney specialist) if the cause isn't clear or if a more serious cause is suspected Admission to hospital is necessary in cases where: there's an underlying cause that needs urgent treatment \u2013 such as a urinary blockage, or if the person is seriously unwell; most people need hospital care to treat the underlying cause, allowing the AKI to get better there's a risk of urinary blockage \u2013 because of prostate disease, for example the person's condition has deteriorated, and regular blood and urine tests are needed to monitor how well their kidneys are working the person has a complication of AKI The majority of people who recover from AKI end up with a very similar level of kidney function as they had before they became ill, or go on to have normal kidney function.   However, some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result. In severe cases, dialysis \u2013 where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water \u2013 may be needed. Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medication. It's also useful to check how much urine you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little urine, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated, or at risk of dehydration, may need to be given fluids via a drip. Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse, or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced detailed guidelines on preventing, detecting and managing AKI. Read the NICE guidelines here. The most serious complications of acute kidney injury are: high levels of potassium in the blood \u2013 in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) \u2013 which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness Page last reviewed: 11/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/acute-kidney-injury"},"Title":"Acute kidney injury"},"22q11 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome)":{"Introduction":{" ":"DiGeorge syndrome is a condition present from birth that can cause a range of lifelong problems, including heart defects and learning difficulties. The severity of the condition varies. Some children can be severely ill and very occasionally may die from it, but many others may grow up without realising they have it. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem with a person's genes called 22q11 deletion. It isn't usually passed on to a child by their parents, but is in a few cases. It's often diagnosed soon after birth with a blood test to check for the genetic fault. This page covers: Symptoms Causes What are the chances of my next child having it? Treatment and support Outlook DiGeorge syndrome can cause a range of problems, but most people won't have all of these. Some of the most common issues are: learning and behaviour problems \u2013 including delays in learning to walk or talk, learning disabilities and problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism speech and hearing problems \u2013 including temporary hearing loss due to frequent ear infections, being slow to start talking and having a \"nasal-sounding\" voice mouth and feeding problems \u2013 including a gap in the top of the mouth or lip (cleft lip or palate), difficulty feeding and sometimes bringing food back up through the nose heart problems \u2013 some children and adults have heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease) hormone problems \u2013 an underactive parathyroid gland (hypoparathyroidism) is common and can lead to problems such as shaking (tremors) and seizures (fits) Other possible problems include: a higher risk of picking up infections \u2013 such as ear infections, oral thrush and chest infections \u2013 because the immune system (the body's natural defence against illness) is weaker than normal bone, muscle and joint problems \u2013 including leg pains that keep coming back, an unusually curved spine (scoliosis) and rheumatoid arthritis short stature \u2013 children and adults may be shorter than average mental health problems \u2013 adults are more likely to have problems such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem called 22q11 deletion. This is where a small piece of genetic material is missing from a person's DNA. In about 9 in 10 (90%) cases, the bit of DNA was missing from the egg or sperm that led to the pregnancy. This can happen by chance when sperm and eggs are made. It isn't a result of anything you did before or during the pregnancy. In these cases, there's usually no family history of DiGeorge syndrome and the risk of it happening again to other children is very small. In around 1 in 10 (10%) cases, the 22q11 deletion is passed on to a child by a parent who has DiGeorge syndrome, although they may not realise they have it if it's mild. If neither parent has DiGeorge syndrome, the risk of having another child with it is thought to be less than 1 in 100 (1%). If one parent has the condition, they have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of passing it on to their child. This applies to each pregnancy. Speak to your GP if you're planning a pregnancy and you have a family history of DiGeorge syndrome or you have a child with it. They may refer you for genetic counselling to talk about your level of risk and discuss your options. These may include: having a blood test to check if you or your partner carry the genetic problem that causes DiGeorge syndrome having tests during pregnancy (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) to check if your baby has the genetic problem that causes the condition \u2013 although this can't show how severely your child will be affected pre-implantation genetic diagnosis \u2013 a type of IVF where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and embryos are tested for genetic problems before they're implanted in the womb (this isn't always available on the NHS) There's currently no cure for DiGeorge syndrome. Children and adults with the condition will be closely monitored to check for problems and these can be treated as they occur if needed. For example, someone with the condition may have: regular hearing tests, blood tests, heart scans and measurements of their height and weight an assessment of their development and learning abilities before starting school \u2013 if your child has a learning disability, they may need extra support at a mainstream school or they may benefit from attending a special school (read more about education for children with learning disabilities) speech therapy to help with speech problems and dietary changes (or sometimes a temporary feeding tube) to help with feeding difficulties physiotherapy for problems with strength and movement, and devices such as shoe inserts (orthoses) for leg pains surgery for more severe problems \u2013 for example, surgery to repair heat defects or an operation to repair a cleft palate You may find it useful to speak to a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or through your doctor. Charities such as Max Appeal may also be a good source of support. Read more advice about caring for a disabled child.  Everyone with DiGeorge syndrome is affected differently and it's difficult to predict how severe the condition will be. Most children survive into adulthood. As someone with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, some symptoms such as heart and speech problems tend to become less of an issue, but behavioural, learning and mental health problems can continue to affect daily life. Many of those who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, but ongoing health problems can sometimes mean life expectancy is a bit lower than normal. It's important to attend regular check-ups so that any problems can be spotted and treated early on. Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently. If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It can often be managed with rest and over-the-counter painkillers. If your arm has suddenly started hurting but you don't think the cause is serious, try caring for it at home by: holding an ice pack (a pack of frozen peas in a tea towel works well) to your arm for 15-20 minutes every few hours for the first couple of days taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain and any inflammation resting the arm and keeping it raised for as long as possible (try resting it on cushions) to help reduce any swelling and pain See your GP if your arm pain doesn't improve after several days, or if there's increasing redness, swelling or pain. See your GP immediately if: your arm pain is brought on by exercise and relieved with rest; it may be a sign of angina (restricted blood supply to the heart) you think you may have a broken arm (but aren't sure) your arm becomes red, hot and swollen over a period of a few hours, and you start to feel generally unwell and develop a high temperature; you may have an infection   Call 999 for an ambulance if: the pain has come on suddenly and your chest feels like it's being squeezed (you may be having a heart attack or stroke) you have obviously broken your arm (it looks the wrong shape) Read on to get a better idea of what might be wrong with your arm, but don't use this information to diagnose yourself \u2013 always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Shoulder pain is covered separately. The most common causes of arm pain are: a simple sprain tennis elbow or golfer's elbow bursitis a squashed or trapped nerve angina  repetitive strain injury (RSI) These are discussed below. ","Squashed or trapped nerve":"Sometimes, the general \"wear and tear\" that occurs in the joints and bones of the spine as a person gets older can cause the nerves in the spinal cord to become squashed or trapped. This can cause pain that radiates from the neck to the arms, and sometimes also pins and needles. This type of wear and tear is known as spinal arthritis or cervical spondylosis. Arm pain caused by cervical spondylosis varies from person to person, but it's typical to have good days and bad days. In most cases, symptoms can be controlled using over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, and exercise.  Read more about treating cervical spondylosis. A trapped nerve can also occur in the arm itself. This can sometimes occur in the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) or in the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome). Pain and tingling in your arm and hand that isn't associated with neck pain may be caused by these conditions. ","Tennis elbow or golfer's elbow":"Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow are conditions that cause pain around the outside or inside of the elbow. They often occur after strenuous overuse of the muscles and tendons near the elbow joint (for example, after playing tennis or golf). The pain caused by tennis elbow or golfer's elbow can last for several weeks or months, but will eventually get better. ","Angina":"Angina is a heart condition caused when the blood supply to the muscles of the heart is restricted. It usually occurs when the arteries supplying the heart become hardened and narrowed. Angina usually causes a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can sometimes spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. The pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress and often only lasts for a few minutes. However, sometimes angina may only be felt as pain in the arm. This is why it's important to see your GP as soon as possible if your arm pain comes on after exercise and is relieved with rest. Angina is a serious warning sign that you have an increased risk of more serious conditions, such as a heart attack or stroke. Learn more about the symptoms of angina. ","Simple sprain":"If you think your pain has been caused by doing more activity than you're used to, you may have just sprained your arm. This means the arm tissues have been stretched, twisted or torn, but aren't permanently damaged. Read about sprains and strains. Avoid exercising the arm and care for it at home using painkillers and an ice pack (see the advice above) until the pain goes away. ","Bursitis":"Repetitive movement of the arm can cause a build-up of fluid over the elbow joint, known as olecranon bursitis (the olecranon is the bony tip of the elbow). This results in pain and swelling. Most cases of bursitis can be successfully treated with painkillers at home, but some cases will be complicated by infections and may need antibiotics (this is more common after sustaining a scratch or penetrating injury to the arm). The pain will usually improve within a few weeks, although the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. ","URL":"/conditions/arm-pain","Repetitive strain injury":"Repetitive strain injury may be diagnosed if your arm or elbow pain seems to be caused by a repetitive task and then fades when the task is stopped. It often occurs in people who work with computers or carry out repetitive manual work. Sometimes, the pain is caused by an underlying problem, such as bursitis or tendonitis. Read more about repetitive strain injury. Less commonly, arm pain may be caused by one of the following conditions or injuries: de Quervain's tenosynovitis \u2013 inflammation of the tendons on the inside of the wrist (read about tendonitis and tenosynovitis) cervical rib \u2013 where you have an extra rib above your normal top rib, which may cause pain, tingling or numbness in the arm inflammation of the nerves in the arm (known as 'brachial and ulnar neuritis') \u2013 this may occur after shingles damage to the nerves connecting the spine and the arm (a 'brachial plexus injury') \u2013 this can be caused by over-stretching the arm or shoulder and most often occurs during contact sports or a motor vehicle accident arthritis of the elbow \u2013 which can cause the elbow joint to become inflamed (swollen, warm and painful) and feel stiff a broken arm, usually caused by a fall onto an outstretched arm Page last reviewed: 18/09/2015 Next review due: 01/09/2018 "},"Title":"Arm or elbow pain"},"AIS":{"Introduction":{"Information about your child":"If your child has AIS, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. ","Introduction ":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a rare condition that affects the development of a child's genitals and reproductive organs. A child born with AIS is genetically male, but the external appearance of their genitals may be female or somewhere between male and female. Someone with AIS may benefit from psychological support, and in some cases may have treatment to alter the appearance of their genitals. Most people born with the condition are unable to have children, but they'll otherwise be perfectly healthy and able to lead a normal life. ","Living with AIS":"Children with AIS and their parents are supported by a team of specialists, who will offer ongoing care and support. They will help you decide whether to raise your child as a girl or a boy while they're still very young. Most children with CAIS are raised as girls, while those with PAIS can be brought up either as girls or boys. It's up to you as a parent, with help from specialists, to decide what you think is in the best interests of your child. Once you've decided, you can learn about the treatments available that can help make your child's body look more consistent with the chosen gender and help them develop more naturally. This may involve surgery to alter the appearance or function of their genitals, and hormone treatment to encourage female or male development during puberty. Read more about how AIS is treated. ","What causes AIS?":"AIS is caused by a genetic fault that's usually passed on to a child by their mother. This genetic fault means that, despite being genetically male, the body doesn't respond to testosterone (the male sex hormone) properly and male sexual development doesn't happen as normal. This means the penis doesn't form or is underdeveloped. The child's genitals may appear female, or between male and female, but they don't have a womb or ovaries and have fully or partially undescended testicles. Women who carry the genetic fault won't have AIS themselves, but there's a one in four chance each child they have will be born with the condition. Read more about the causes of AIS. ","Gender identity and gender dysphoria":"Most children with AIS grow up to feel they are the gender their parents chose to raise them as. This feeling is known as their gender identity. In a few cases, older children and adults with AIS feel their gender identity doesn't match the gender they've been raised as. This is known as gender dysphoria. People with gender dysphoria often have a desire to live as a member of the opposite sex, and may want treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity. If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be told about the issues of gender identity that could arise as your child gets older. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome","Types of AIS":"There are two main types of AIS, which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone. These are: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) \u2013 where testosterone has no effect on sexual development, so the genitals are entirely female partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) \u2013 where testosterone still has some effect on sexual development, so the genitals are often between male and female PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different. CAIS can be more difficult to spot, as the genitals usually look normal for a girl. It's often not diagnosed until puberty, when periods don't start and pubic and underarm hair doesn't develop. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and diagnosing AIS. ","Support and advice":"You and your child will be offered psychological support to help you understand and cope with the diagnosis of AIS. Children may not need this while they're very young, but they usually do as they get older. You'll be given advice about how and when to discuss the condition with your child. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (AISSG) and DSD Families. "},"Causes":{"How babies with AIS develop":"In early pregnancy, all unborn babies have identical genitals. As they grow inside the womb, they develop either male or female genitals, depending on the pair of sex chromosomes they receive from their parents and their ability to respond to the sex hormones they make. Sex chromosomes are bundles of genes \u2013 called X or Y \u2013 that play a vital role in a baby's sexual development. Females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), while males usually have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Children with AIS have male (XY) chromosomes, but the genetic fault they inherit prevents their body responding to the testosterone they make. This means male sexual development doesn't happen as normal. The genitals appear female or between male and female, but a womb and ovaries don't develop internally. ","How AIS is passed on":"In most cases, the genetic fault is passed on to a child by their mother. The faulty gene is found on the mother's X chromosome. As the mother has two X chromosomes, the normal chromosome is able to make up for the faulty one, so she is a carrier of the faulty gene, but doesn't have AIS and is able to have children. Any genetically female (XX) children the mother has will also inherit two X chromosomes and will be unaffected, although they too may be carriers and be able to pass the genetic fault on to any children they have. If the mother has a genetically male (XY) child, there's a chance they could pass on the faulty X chromosome, in addition to the Y chromosome the child gets from their father. If this happens, the Y chromosome won't be able to make up for the faulty X chromosome and the baby will develop AIS. This means women who carry the faulty X chromosome have a: one in four chance of giving birth to a girl who is unaffected, but can pass on the altered gene to her children one in four chance of having a boy who is unaffected one in four chance of having a girl who is unaffected and doesn't carry the altered gene one in four chance of having a child with AIS This is known as X-linked inheritance. Read about genetic inheritance for more information. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Causes of androgen insensitivity syndrome ":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is caused by a genetic fault that means the body can't respond to testosterone properly. The faulty gene is usually passed on to a child by their mother. Testosterone is the sex hormone produced by the testicles. It controls the development of the usual changes expected in boys, such as penis growth and the testicles moving into the scrotum. ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome"},"Title":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome","Diagnosis":{"Appearance and sexual development":"Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is usually spotted soon after birth because the genitals have an unusual appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) isn't usually diagnosed at birth because the genitals look normal for a girl, although the condition may be picked up if the child develops a hernia. Hernias are where an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the surrounding tissue. They can occur in babies with CAIS as a result of the testicles failing to move from the tummy into the scrotum. When the baby has an operation to repair the hernia, the surgeon may find the testicles inside the hernia or in the tummy, and tests may be arranged to check for CAIS. If a baby with CAIS doesn't develop a hernia, the condition may go undiagnosed until puberty, when she doesn't start having periods and doesn't develop pubic and underarm hair. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and types of AIS. ","Testing family members and unborn babies":"If someone in your family has AIS and the specific genetic fault causing it has been identified, it may be possible to have a blood test to check if you carry the same fault and are at risk of passing it on to any children you have. Testing can also be carried out in unborn babies when there's a known family history of AIS. There are two main tests that can be carried out during pregnancy to determine whether a baby has the condition: chorionic villus sampling (CVS) \u2013 a sample of cells are removed from the afterbirth (placenta) for testing, usually with a needle; this is usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy amniocentesis \u2013 a needle is used to extract a sample of the fluid surrounding the baby, called amniotic fluid, for testing; this is usually carried out between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy It can be difficult to decide whether or not to have these tests, so it's a good idea to speak to a genetic counsellor first. It's also important to be aware CVS and amniocentesis are estimated to carry around a 1 in 100 chance of causing a miscarriage. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Diagnosing androgen insensitivity syndrome ":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is sometimes diagnosed soon after a baby is born, although often it's not noticed until a child reaches puberty. Doctors may suspect AIS based on a child's appearance and sexual development, but some tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome","Tests and scans":"If AIS is suspected, blood tests can be used to: check the sex chromosomes \u2013 sex chromosomes are bundles of genetic material that determine a person's genetic sex; if their genetic sex is different from their physical appearance, they may have AIS check for a genetic fault \u2013 AIS is caused by a problem on the X chromosome, the sex chromosome a child with AIS receives from their mother measure sex hormone levels \u2013 children with AIS tend to have high levels of testosterone (the male sex hormone) in their blood An ultrasound scan can also be carried out to confirm the absence of the womb and ovaries. Children with AIS often have female genitals, but no female internal reproductive organs. If a surgeon thinks they've found testicles in a baby's tummy during a hernia repair operation, a small tissue sample (biopsy) may be taken and analysed to confirm they are testicles and not ovaries. "},"Living with":{"Support for parents":"If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be offered counselling to help you come to terms with your emotions. A diagnosis of AIS can come as a shock to parents, and feelings of shame, guilt, anger and anxiety are common. Talking to other parents who have a child with AIS may also help. There are organisations that can put you in touch with other families affected by the condition. You can find contact details for the AIS Support Group (AISSG) on their website, or call the Contact a Family helpline on 0808 808 3555. ","Choosing your child's gender":"As a parent of a child with AIS, one of the biggest decisions you'll have to make will be to choose which gender to raise your child as. You'll be given lots of information to help you make this decision.  Most parents of children with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) choose to raise their child as a girl, as they have female genitals and often ultimately end up identifying with being female. The decision is more difficult if your child has partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), as their genitals may have both male and female aspects. You're entitled to specialist advice about your child's future development and any gender identity issues that could arise later on. Most children with PAIS stay with the gender they've been raised as. However, some people feel this doesn't represent who they are and decide to switch gender in later life. ","Hormone therapy":"If the testicles are removed when a girl with CAIS is a child, treatment with the hormone oestrogen (the female sex hormone) is usually started at the age of 10 or 11, so female development begins at an age consistent with puberty. This won't cause periods to start, as people with CAIS don't have a womb, but it will help them develop a more female body shape. It will also be continued after puberty to stop them developing menopausal symptoms and weak bones (osteoporosis). Women with CAIS who had their testicles removed after puberty will also need to take oestrogen to prevent the menopause and osteoporosis. Children with PAIS may also need to take hormone supplements. Girls with PAIS who have their testicles removed may need oestrogen to encourage puberty. Boys with PAIS may need androgens (male sex hormones) to encourage certain male characteristics, such as the growth of facial hair, penis growth, or deepening of the voice. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Surgery":"Children with CAIS and PAIS will sometimes need surgery to help change their body and genitals to be more consistent with the gender they're raised as. Some procedures may be best carried out while your child is still young, but others can be delayed until they're older. Children with AIS sometimes develop a hernia (where an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the surrounding tissue) soon after birth. This is a result of their testicles failing to move from the tummy to the scrotum. This can be repaired by closing and strengthening the gap created in the surrounding tissues. The testicles may also be removed during another operation. Girls with CAIS will usually have their internal testicles removed, as there's a very small risk they could become cancerous if left in place. This procedure is often delayed until after puberty because the testicles produce hormones that help girls with CAIS develop a normal female body shape without hormone treatment, and the risk of the testicles becoming cancerous before adulthood is extremely low. If you decide you'd prefer for your child's testicles to be removed before puberty, hormone treatment will be needed to help them develop a more female body shape. Boys with PAIS may be born with fully or partially undescended testicles. If this happens, an operation can be carried out to move the testicles into the scrotum. Read more about treating undescended testicles. Surgery can also be carried out to straighten the penis and correct hypospadias, where the hole that carries urine out of the body is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the end. Girls with AIS often have a shorter vagina than normal, which can make having sex difficult. Treatment for this is usually delayed until after puberty, so she can decide if she wants treatment for it and choose what treatment she prefers. In many cases, surgery isn't necessary because the vagina can be lengthened using a method called dilation. This involves inserting small plastic rods that gradually widen and deepen the vagina. Alternatively, a procedure to remove skin and tissue from the genital area and use it to reconstruct the vagina can be carried out. Women with PAIS can also have surgery to reduce the size of their clitoris. This may make it less sensitive, but achieving an orgasm should still be possible. Boys with PAIS will sometimes experience some breast development around puberty. If this occurs, an operation can be carried out to remove the breast tissue. Read more about male breast reductions. ","Talking to your child about AIS":"Parents often wonder when and what they should say to their child about their condition. Many people feel it's best to explain the basic facts about AIS to the child as soon as possible. They can then be given more detailed information as they get older, as their ability to understand increases. It's usually recommended that a child fully understands their condition before they reach puberty. This can be a stressful time anyway, but it could be very traumatic if your child starts puberty without knowing about the possible changes they may experience, or the differences between them and their friends. The situation can be more difficult if a girl with CAIS isn't diagnosed until she has started puberty. The health professionals looking after your child can advise you on how to talk to your child and support you through this process. ","Support for children":"Some young children with AIS don't need psychological support because their condition is completely natural to them. However, as a child gets older, they may need support from a therapist with experience in AIS to help them understand and cope with their condition. A long-term relationship between the child and therapist is ideal so any new issues can be discussed as the child matures.

Various treatment options are available to someone with AIS, including reconstructive surgery and hormone therapy. However, psychological support and advice to help you deal with any issues that arise as a result of your child's condition is probably the most important aspect of care. With appropriate care and support, most people with AIS are able to come to terms with their condition and lead normal lives. "},"Symptoms":{"Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome":"The development of children with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) can vary. In many cases, the genitalia are between male and female from birth. For example, affected babies may have: a very small penis or an enlarged clitoris (the sexual organ that helps women reach sexual climax) partially undescended testicles hypospadias \u2013 where the hole that carries urine out of the body is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the end Children with PAIS are usually raised as boys, although they may experience poor penis development during puberty and develop small breasts. Most children with PAIS raised as boys will be infertile. Some children with PAIS are raised as girls.

Symptoms of HACE: headache weakness nausea and vomiting loss of co-ordination feeling confused hallucinations A person with HACE often doesn't realise they're ill, and may insist they're alright and want to be left alone. HACE can develop quickly over a few hours. It can be fatal if it's not treated immediately. Treating HACE: move down to a lower altitude immediately take dexamethasone give bottled oxygen, if available Dexamethasone is a steroid medication that reduces swelling of the brain.  If you can't go down immediately, dexamethasone can help relieve symptoms until it's safe to do so. You should go to hospital as soon as possible for follow-up treatment. ","Introduction ":"Altitude sickness can occur when you travel to a high altitude too quickly. Breathing becomes difficult because you aren't able to take in as much oxygen. Altitude sickness, also called acute mountain sickness (AMS), can become a medical emergency if ignored. Age, sex or physical fitness have no bearing on your likelihood of getting altitude sickness. Just because you haven't had it before doesn't mean you won't develop it on another trip. This page covers: Symptoms Medication Prevention Treatment Complications Symptoms of altitude sickness usually develop between 6 and 24 hours after reaching altitudes above 3,000 metres (9,842 feet) above sea level. Symptoms are similar to those of a bad hangover. They include: headache nausea and vomiting dizziness tiredness loss of appetite shortness of breath The symptoms are usually worse at night. It's not possible to get altitude sickness in the UK because the highest mountain, Ben Nevis in Scotland, is only 1,345m. Consider travelling with these medicines for altitude sickness: acetazolamide to prevent and treat high altitude sickness ibuprofen and paracetamol for headaches anti-sickness medication, like promethazine, for nausea The best way to prevent altitude sickness is to travel to altitudes above 3,000m slowly. It usually takes a few days for the body to get used to a change in altitude. You should also: avoid flying directly to areas of high altitude, if possible take 2-3 days to get used to high altitudes before going above 3,000m avoid climbing more than 300-500m a day have a rest day every 600-900m you go up, or every 3-4 days make sure you're drinking enough water avoid alcohol avoid strenuous exercise for the first 24 hours eat a light but high calorie diet avoid smoking Acetazolamide, available from a travel clinic and, in some areas, your GP, can help prevent symptoms. It's thought to help you adjust quicker to high altitudes. You should begin taking the medication 1-2 days before you start to go up in altitude and continue to take it while going up. If using acetazolamide, you should still go up gradually and follow the general prevention advice. If you get symptoms of altitude sickness while taking acetazolamide, you should rest or go down until you feel better before going up again. If you think you have altitude sickness: stop and rest where you are don't go any higher for at least 24-48 hours if you have a headache, take ibuprofen or paracetamol if you feel sick, take an anti-sickness medication, like promethazine make sure you're drinking enough water avoid alcohol don't smoke avoid exercise Acetazolamide can be used to reduce the severity of your symptoms, but it won't completely hide them. Tell your travel companions how you feel, even if your symptoms are mild \u2013 there's a danger your judgement can become clouded. You can continue going up with care once you feel fully recovered. If you don't feel any better after 24 hours, you should go down by at least 500m (about 1,600 feet). Don't attempt to climb again until your symptoms have completely disappeared. After 2-3 days, your body should have adjusted to the altitude and your symptoms should disappear. See a doctor if your symptoms don't improve or get worse. If the symptoms of altitude sickness are ignored, they can lead to life-threatening conditions affecting the brain or lungs. ","High altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE)":"High altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) is a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Symptoms of HAPE: blue tinge to the skin (cyanosis) breathing difficulties, even when resting tightness in the chest a persistent cough, bringing up pink or white frothy liquid (sputum) tiredness and weakness The symptoms of HAPE can start to appear a few days after arrival at high altitude. It can be fatal if it's not treated immediately. Treating HAPE: move down to a lower altitude immediately take nifedipine give bottled oxygen, if available The medication nifedipine helps to reduce chest tightness and ease breathing. You should go to hospital as soon as possible for follow-up treatment. If you've had HAPE, you can register with the International HAPE Database to help develop new treatments for the condition.

Treatment for ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at. If you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least two weeks. After this point, it's usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption. If you have a more serious form of ARLD \u2013 alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis \u2013 life-long abstinence is recommended. This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease. Stopping drinking isn't easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem. Nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don't stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure. ","Withdrawal symptoms":"If you're abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes three to seven days from the time of your last drink. Many people initially experience disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month. In some cases, you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process. Some people need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so their progress can be closely monitored. If you're staying at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service. ","Self-help groups":"Many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is Alcoholics Anonymous, but there are many other groups that can help. See alcohol support for more information about the help available. Malnutrition is common in people with ARLD, so it's important to eat a balanced diet to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need. Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid. See tips for a lower salt diet for more information. The damage to your liver can also mean it's unable to store glycogen \u2013 a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet. Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat three or four small meals a day, rather than one or two large meals. Your GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian. In the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube inserted through the nose and into the stomach. The use of medication to directly treat ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued there's limited evidence for its effectiveness. For people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. Specific treatment with corticosteroids or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition. Nutritional support (see above) is also an important part of treatment in these cases. Other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include: anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication) ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat overactive thyroid glands) However, there's a lack of good evidence that these help and they're no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis. In the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to liver failure. A liver transplant is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure. A liver transplant may be considered if: you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol you're otherwise well enough to survive such an operation you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life If you have ARLD, it's important to talk to your GP or pharmacist before taking over-the-counter or prescription medications. ARLD can affect the way the body processes some medications.

The first treatment usually offered is psychological therapy. This involves seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing.

"},"Introduction":{" ":"Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. ARLD doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Read more about: symptoms of ARLD diagnosing ARLD With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is very common in the UK \u2013 the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD. There are three main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below. ","Cirrhosis":"Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. A person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least five more years. There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol support services. A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Read more about treating ARLD. Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure. Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer Read more about the complications of ARLD. The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health. See our drinking and alcohol pages for more information and advice. Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","Alcoholic hepatitis":"Alcoholic hepatitis \u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis \u2013 is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. ","Alcoholic fatty liver disease":"Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for two weeks, your liver should return to normal. ","URL":"/conditions/Liver_disease_(alcoholic)"},"Complications":{" ":"A number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD). Some of the main complications associated with the condition are described below. Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis. It occurs when the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level. When the liver becomes severely scarred, it's harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines. The blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These new blood vessels are known as varices. If the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the walls of the varices to split and bleed. This can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to anaemia. Alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like. Split varices can be treated by using an endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices. A person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites. Initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic. One of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death. One of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. If the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the blood increase. A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy. Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include: agitation confusion disorientation muscle stiffness muscle tremors difficulty speaking in very serious cases, a coma Hepatic encephalopathy may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood. Liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing liver cancer. Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse. It's estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with cirrhosis will develop liver cancer.

The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD. There are two ways alcohol misuse (drinking too much) can cause ARLD. These are: drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time (binge drinking) can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause hepatitis and cirrhosis, the more serious types of ARLD Evidence suggests people who regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week Read more about alcohol units and how to calculate them. As well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These include: being overweight or obese being female \u2013 women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol having a pre-existing liver condition, such as hepatitis C  genetics \u2013 alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Liver_disease_(alcoholic)"},"Title":"Alcohol-related liver disease","Diagnosis":{" ":"Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver. This is because the condition causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages. If a doctor suspects ARLD, they'll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption. It's important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. This could lead to a delay in the treatment you need. Blood tests used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal at many stages of liver disease. Blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn't functioning properly. A blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage. Lab Tests Online has more information on liver function tests. If your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD \u2013 either alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis \u2013 you may need further tests. These are described below. ","Liver biopsy":"During a liver biopsy, a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. The biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. Specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage. ","Endoscopy":"An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end. During an endoscopy, the instrument is passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach. Pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.

This may include: an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred. "},"Symptoms":{" ":"In many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don't have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged. If you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these are often quite vague, such as: abdominal (tummy) pain  loss of appetite fatigue feeling sick diarrhoea feeling generally unwell As the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as: yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to a build-up of fluid (oedema) swelling in your abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites a high temperature (fever) and shivering attacks very itchy skin hair loss unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers) blotchy red palms significant weight loss weakness and muscle wasting confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (insomnia) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to internal bleeding a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can't process them) ARLD doesn't often cause symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of the symptoms above. Read about alcohol misuse (drinking too much).  Contact your GP for advice if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse. A good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of four questions: Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking? Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? Have you ever drunk an \"eye-opener\", which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves? If you answer \"yes\" to one or more of the questions above, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP. See your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD.

It reduces your risk of getting blood clots by affecting cells in your blood called platelets. It's also called Plavix and Grepid. This page covers: When it's used How and when to take it Side effects Taking it with other medicines, food and alcohol Who may not be able to take it You may be given clopidogrel if you have or have had: a heart attack unstable angina a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) peripheral arterial disease an operation on your heart or blood vessels, such as a coronary stent insertion These situations mean you're at an increased chance of getting a serious blood clot. Taking clopidogrel can help reduce this risk. Treatment may be for a few weeks or months, or it may be lifelong. Clopidogrel comes as a tablet that you take once a day. The usual dose is 75mg a day, although occasionally a single higher dose \u2013 such as 300mg or 600mg \u2013 may be recommended to begin with. Take clopidogrel at the same time each day, with or without food. Don't stop taking it unless advised by a doctor \u2013 sometimes you may be told to stop taking it for a short time, such as before surgery. If you forget to take a dose and it's more than 12 hours until you're due to take your next one, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If you forget to take a dose and it's less than 12 hours until you're due to take your next one, skip the missed dose and take your next one as normal \u2013 don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one as this can be dangerous. If you accidentally take an extra dose or doses, contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice. Clopidogrel can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. Some side effects are listed below. Check the leaflet that comes with your medication for a full list. ","Common side effects":"The following are common side effects that affect between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people: bruising or bleeding under the skin nosebleeds diarrhoea tummy pain indigestion \u2013 you may be prescribed an additional medication to help prevent this increased bleeding from wounds Tell your doctor if these side effects bother you or don't go away. ","Serious side effects":"Less common, but more serious side effects, include: severe bleeding or pain vomiting blood weakness or numbness in an arm or leg blood in your pee or blood in your poo an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a sudden, itchy rash, swelling of the lips, mouth or throat, and breathing problems Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you're having an allergic reaction. Speak to your doctor or call NHS 111 immediately if you have any other worrying or unusual side effects while taking clopidogrel. Taking clopidogrel with other medications can affect how well either medication works, or increase your chances of getting side effects. For example, this can happen if clopidogrel is taken with: aspirin \u2013 although your doctor may sometimes recommend taking both together if they think you need them to prevent blood clots non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen \u2013 take paracetamol instead if you need pain relief anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban other types of antiplatelet medication, such as ticagrelor, dipyridamole and prasugrel antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram some indigestion medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole and esomeprazole Always read the leaflet that comes with your medication to check if it's safe to take. If you're not sure, ask a pharmacist or your GP for advice. No foods affect clopidogrel. You can drink alcohol while taking it, but try to not to drink too much because this may irritate your stomach. Check with your doctor before taking clopidogrel if you: have a stomach ulcer, or have had stomach ulcers in the past have had bleeding on your brain (brain haemorrhage) have haemophilia or another bleeding disorder have a liver or kidney problem have had an allergic reaction to any medication before are taking other medications \u2013 this can sometimes cause problems are pregnant or breastfeeding Clopidogrel should only be taken by children if recommended by a specialist doctor.

It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful. Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. In severe cases, there's a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment. However, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it's possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Diagnosis Treatment Managing related conditions The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects the hands, feet, knees, neck, spine and elbows. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints. There may be times when your symptoms improve (known as remission) and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they do occur. See your GP if you experience persistent pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints \u2013 even if you haven't been diagnosed with psoriasis. If you've been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. Make sure you let your doctor know if you're experiencing any problems with your joints. Between one and two in every five people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. It usually develops within 10 years of psoriasis being diagnosed, although some people may experience problems with their joints before they notice any symptoms affecting their skin. Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to occur as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. However, it's not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don't. If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment. The British Association of Dermatologists website has information on the psoriasis epidemiology screening tool (PEST) (PDF, 209kb). This is a questionnaire you may be asked to fill out, which helps your doctor decide if you need a referral. People with psoriasis should be asked to fill this out annually. A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints. They'll also try to rule out other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including: blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis X-rays or scans of your joints The main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life. For most people, this involves trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible. The main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below and include: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) biological therapies ","Biological treatments":"Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if: your psoriatic arthritis hasn't responded to at least two different types of DMARD you're not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD Biological drugs work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack the lining of your joints. Some of the biological medicines you may be offered include: adalimumab apremilast certolizumab etanercep golimumab infliximab secukinumab ustekinumab The most common side effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren't usually serious. However, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you'll usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these. Biological treatments can also make you more likely to develop infections. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as: a sore throat a high temperature (fever) diarrhoea Biological medication will usually be recommended for three months at first, to see if it helps. If it's effective, the medication can be continued. Otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment. ","Complementary therapies":"There's not enough scientific evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis. There's also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment. Complementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so talk to your GP, specialist or pharmacist if you're thinking of using any. As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions \u2013 such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) \u2013 if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke. Your doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD and offer additional treatment, if necessary. You can also help yourself by: having a good balance between rest and regular physical activity losing weight, if you are overweight not smoking only drinking moderate amounts of alcohol Read more about:  Living with psoriasis Preventing CVD ","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)":"Your GP may first prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. There are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways: traditional NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac COX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib Like all medications, NSAIDs can have side effects. Your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible. If side effects do occur, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include indigestion and stomach ulcers. A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs \u2013 a PPI helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces. Read more about the side effects of NSAIDs. If NSAIDs alone aren't helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended. ","Corticosteroids":"Like NSAIDs, corticosteroids can help reduce pain and swelling. If you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months. Corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help lots of joints. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it. ","Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)":"Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. They can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be. Leflunomide is often the first drug given for psoriatic arthritis, although sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be considered as alternatives. It can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working, so it's important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn't seem to be working at first. ","Your care team":"As well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by: a specialist nurse \u2013 who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team a dermatologist (skin specialist) \u2013 who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms a physiotherapist \u2013 who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile an occupational therapist \u2013 who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these a psychologist \u2013 who can offer psychological support if you need it Page last reviewed: 18/11/2016 Next review due: 18/11/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/psoriatic-arthritis"},"Title":"Psoriatic arthritis"},"Asthma":{"Treatment":{" ":"There's currently no cure for asthma, but treatment can help control the symptoms so you're able to live a normal, active life.

The main treatments are: avoiding asthma triggers whenever possible short-acting reliever inhalers \u2013 inhalers used when needed to quickly relieve asthma symptoms for a short time, by relaxing the breathing tubes preventer inhalers \u2013 inhalers used regularly every day to reduce inflammation in the breathing tubes and stop asthma symptoms occurring combined preventer and long-acting reliever inhalers \u2013 inhalers used regularly every day which help stop asthma symptoms occurring and relax the breathing tubes for a longer period You'll usually draw up a personal action plan with your doctor or asthma nurse.

Your doctor or asthma nurse will show you how to use your inhaler properly, or how to help your child use theirs. There are several different inhalers available, which are used in slightly different ways. The two main types are: pressurised canisters \u2013 you press the inhaler while breathing in and it releases a spray of medicine into your lungs (these are sometimes used with a device called a spacer \u2013  see below) dry powder inhalers \u2013 non-pressurised devices that release powdered medication when you breathe in quickly and forcefully Pressurised containers can be used by most people with asthma. Dry powder inhalers may not be suitable for people who find it difficult to inhale sharply and forcefully, such as young children, the frail and elderly, and those with persistent breathing difficulties.  It's important to ensure that you use your inhaler correctly, as this will make it easier to control your symptoms and will reduce the risk of any side effects. Pressurised canister inhalers can work better if used with a spacer \u2013 a hollow plastic tube or container with a mouthpiece at one end and a hole for the inhaler at the other. When using a spacer, the spray from the inhaler is released into the container, where it's held while you breathe in very slowly until your lungs are full. You then hold your breath for a few seconds so the medicine settles in your lungs. Benefits of spacers include: they can make inhalers more effective because more of the medicine reaches the lungs less medicine stays in the mouth or is swallowed, so problems such as oral thrush are less likely to occur they're easier to use for children who may otherwise find it difficult to use an inhaler correctly a face mask can be attached to the mouthpiece to make it easier for very young children to breathe in the medicine Spacers are usually recommended for children with asthma, but they should ideally be used by everyone who uses a preventer spray inhaler, especially if they need to take high doses.

If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer. Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma. It may sometimes be possible to: substitute or remove the substance that's triggering your asthma from your workplace redeploy you to another role within the company provide you with protective breathing equipment But you may need to consider changing your job or relocating away from your work.

They normally contain a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which widens the airways and makes breathing easier. They typically work for no more than 15 minutes or so. Everyone with asthma should have a reliever inhaler, although you ideally shouldn't need to use it very often. You may not need it at all if you are using a regular preventer inhaler (see below). Speak to your GP or asthma nurse if you need to use it three or more times a week, as this means a preventer inhaler (see below) may be needed. Reliever inhalers are generally very safe medicines and have few side effects as long as they're not used too much. After using the inhaler, some people may experience: mild shaking of the hands (tremors) headaches muscle cramps a fast, pounding or fluttering heartbeat (palpitations) These side effects aren't dangerous and should pass within a few minutes. Want to know more? Asthma UK: reliever inhalers ","Preventer inhalers show":"Preventer inhalers, which are usually brown or orange, are used twice or occasionally once a day to stop asthma symptoms occurring. They contain inhaled steroid medication, which works by reducing the inflammation (swelling) and sensitivity of the airways. Preventer inhalers are usually recommended if you have asthma symptoms more than twice a week. It's important to use them regularly even if you don't have symptoms, because they keep the inflammation in the breathing tubes under control, and this can get worse again if you stop using your inhaler. Preventer inhalers don't work straight away, so you'll need to keep using your reliever inhaler to begin with. You may also need to use your reliever inhaler if you do experience any occasional symptoms. Speak to your GP or asthma nurse if you continue to have frequent symptoms while using a preventer inhaler. Preventer inhalers are very safe at usual doses, but they can cause side effects at high doses, especially with long-term use. Possible side effects include: a fungal infection of the mouth or throat (oral thrush) a hoarse voice a sore throat Using a spacer (see How to use your inhaler below) can help prevent these side effects, as can rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after using your inhaler. Want to know more? Asthma UK: preventer inhalers ","URL":"/conditions/Asthma","Other treatments show":"If your symptoms aren't well controlled with reliever and preventer inhalers, you may need one or more of the treatments below. Long-acting reliever inhalers work in the same way as normal reliever inhalers, but their effects can last for up to 12 hours so they can be used less often. They usually contain a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist). Long-acting reliever inhalers are always used alongside preventer inhalers, often in a single combined inhaler. This can allow your preventer dose to be lowered, while still keeping your symptoms under control. Combination inhalers are usually purple, maroon or red. Long-acting relievers can cause similar side effects to short-acting relievers, such as temporary shaking or cramps. It's important never to take a long-acting reliever on its own without a preventer. This may temporarily relieve your symptoms, while allowing the inflammation in the breathing tubes to build up, which could result in a sudden severe asthma attack. If you still have symptoms despite using a preventer inhaler and a long-acting reliever inhaler, your doctor may suggest taking tablets to control your symptoms. The main tablets used for asthma are: leukotriene receptor antagonists \u2013 taken once a day to stop the airways becoming inflamed (syrup and powder forms are also available) theophyllines \u2013 taken twice a day to help widen the airways steroid tablets \u2013 see below Leukotriene receptor agonists can cause tummy (abdominal) pain and headaches. Side effects of theophylline tablets include nausea, vomiting, tremors and palpitations. Different people require different doses of theophylline for it to work best. Your GP will periodically measure the level of medication in your blood to check it's not too high or too low. If it's too low, the medication may not work, and if it's too high, side effects are more likely. If your asthma is still not under control, an asthma specialist may prescribe regular steroid tablets. Steroids are powerful medicines that can reduce inflammation in the airways. They can be used in two ways: as an immediate, short-term treatment if you have occasional severe asthma attacks as a long-term treatment if other medications don't control your symptoms well enough Long-term or frequent use of steroid tablets can cause side effects, such as: osteoporosis (fragile bones)   high blood pressure  diabetes  increased appetite, leading to weight gain cataracts and glaucoma   thinning of the skin   easy bruising   muscle weakness, especially around the thighs and shoulders mood changes With the exception of increased appetite, which is a very common side effect, most of these unwanted effects are uncommon. You'll be monitored regularly while taking steroid tablets to check for signs of any problems. Omalizumab (brand name Xolair), is a new type of medication that can sometimes help prevent frequent, severe asthma attacks that are triggered by allergies. It's less effective at relieving persistent symptoms. The National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that omalizumab can be used in people over six years of age with allergy-related asthma who need continuous or frequent treatment with steroid tablets. It's only available on prescription from an asthma specialist and isn't suitable for everyone with asthma. It's given as an injection every two to four weeks. If your symptoms aren't under control within 16 weeks, treatment should be stopped. It may be continued indefinitely if it does help. Side effects of omalizumab can include temporary pain, swelling, redness and itching where the injection is given. Mepolizumab (brand name Nucala) is a new type of medicine that can help control severe asthma in some people. NICE recommends it for some adults who have severe, difficult to control asthma that's associated with a high number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils are white blood cells that cause the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs to become swollen and sensitive in some people with asthma. Mepolizumab reduces the number of these cells in the blood, which may reduce the number of bad asthma attacks you have and/or mean your dose of steroid tablets can be reduced or stopped. It's given by injection once every four weeks. If it doesn't help after a year, the treatment will be stopped. If it does help, it can be used as a long-term treatment. Common side effects of mepolizumab include headaches, back pain, and pain, redness and/or swelling where the injection is given. Want to know more?

It involves damaging some of the muscles surrounding the airways, which can help stop them becoming narrow. The procedure is carried out either with sedation (where you're awake but take medication to help you relax) or under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). A bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) is passed down to your lungs through your mouth or nose. Heat is then used to damage the muscles around the airways. Three treatment sessions are usually needed, with at least three weeks between each session. There's some evidence to suggest this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma. But the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. There's a small risk it could trigger an asthma attack and cause other complications. Make sure you discuss this procedure fully with your doctor or surgeon if it's offered. Want to know more?

It affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood, although it can also appear for the first time in adults. There's currently no cure for asthma, but there are simple treatments that can help keep the symptoms under control so it doesn't have a significant impact on your life. Some people, particularly children, may eventually grow out of asthma. But for others it's a lifelong condition. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatments How long does asthma last? Complications The main symptoms of asthma are: wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing) breathlessness a tight chest \u2013 which may feel like a band is tightening around it  coughing The severity of the symptoms varies from person to person. They usually come and go, but for some people they're more persistent. Asthma symptoms can sometimes get temporarily worse. This is known as an asthma attack. Read more about the symptoms of asthma. See your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. Several conditions can cause similar symptoms, such as a chest infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), so it's important to get a proper diagnosis and correct treatment. Your GP will usually be able to diagnose asthma by asking about your or your child's symptoms and carrying out some simple breathing tests. But these are often difficult to do in infants and young children, so the diagnosis may be made on the basis of symptoms and response to a trial of treatment with an inhaler. Read more about how asthma is diagnosed. Asthma is caused by inflammation (swelling) of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This inflammation makes the breathing tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily become narrow. This may occur randomly, or after exposure to a trigger. The tubes may also sometimes become clogged with sticky mucus. Common asthma triggers include: allergens, such as house dust mites, animal fur and pollens other irritants, such as cigarette smoke, strong smells, gases and cold air exercise chest infections The reason why some people develop asthma isn't fully understood, although it's known that you're more likely to develop it if you have a close relative with the condition. Read more about the causes of asthma.   While there's currently no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition. Most asthma treatments are taken using an inhaler, a small device that delivers a spray or powder medicine to your breathing tubes as you breathe in.

Asthma is a long-term condition for many people \u2013 particularly if it first develops in adulthood. In children, it sometimes disappears or improves during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. The symptoms can usually be controlled with treatment and most people will have normal and active lives, although some people with more severe asthma may have persistent problems. Although asthma can normally be kept under control, it's still a serious condition that can cause a number of complications. This is why it's so important to follow your treatment plan and not ignore your symptoms if they're getting worse. Badly controlled asthma can cause issues such as: persistent tiredness underperformance or absence from work or school psychological problems \u2013 including stress, anxiety and depression disruption of your work and leisure because of unexpected visits to your GP or hospital lung infections (pneumonia) in children, delays in growth or puberty There's also a risk of life-threatening complications, such as severe asthma attacks.   Page last reviewed: 12/09/2016 Next review due: 12/09/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Asthma"},"Causes":{" ":"The exact cause of asthma is unknown. People with asthma have inflamed (swollen) and \"sensitive\" airways that become narrow and clogged with sticky mucus in response to certain triggers. Factors such as a genes, air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and modern hygiene standards have been suggested as possible causes, but there's not currently enough evidence to be certain whether any of these do cause asthma. While the cause of asthma is unknown, there are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing it. These include: a family history of asthma or related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema, food allergy or hay fever having another atopic condition yourself having bronchiolitis (a common childhood lung infection) as a child exposure to tobacco smoke as a child your mother smoking during pregnancy  being born prematurely or with a low birth weight Some people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job. Asthma symptoms often occur in response to a trigger. Common triggers include: infections \u2013 particularly infections of the upper airways, such as colds and flu allergens \u2013 including pollen, dust mites, animal fur (\"dander\") or feathers airborne irritants \u2013 including cigarette smoke, fumes and pollution medicines \u2013 particularly painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include aspirin and ibuprofen, and beta-blockers emotions \u2013 including stress or laughter food additives \u2013 including sulphites (often found in pickled products, wine, beer and dried fruit) and tartrazine (a yellow food colouring) weather conditions \u2013 including sudden changes in temperature, cold air, windy days, thunderstorms and hot, humid days indoor conditions \u2013 including mould or damp and chemicals in carpets and flooring materials exercise food allergies \u2013 including allergies to nuts and other foods Once you know your triggers, trying to avoid them may help control your asthma symptoms.

Your GP will often be able to diagnose asthma. But they may refer you to a specialist if they're not sure what's causing your symptoms. Your GP may ask: whether you have typical symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing and breathlessness when the symptoms happen and how often whether you've noticed anything that might trigger your symptoms if you have any conditions that often occur alongside asthma, such as eczema or hay fever The tests below may be used to help confirm the diagnosis, although they aren't always practical \u2013 particularly in young children. If your GP feels tests aren't needed, he or she may just give you or your child an asthma inhaler to use for a short time. If this helps, it's likely you or your child have asthma. Two simple breathing tests are sometimes used to help your doctor diagnose asthma. ","Spirometry":"A test called spirometry can help show how well your lungs and airways are working. It involves breathing out as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer. The spirometer takes two measurements \u2013 the amount of air you breathe out in the first second and the total amount of air you can hold in your lungs. The readings are compared with a normal measurement for someone of your age, gender and height to work out if your airways are narrow. Sometimes the test may be repeated a few minutes after taking a puff from an asthma inhaler to see if your result improves. If your breathing tubes are narrow at the time of the test, a better result after using an inhaler means it's likely you have asthma. ","Airway responsiveness":"An airway responsiveness test is a test that measures how your airways react to an asthma trigger. During the test, you'll usually be asked to breathe in a medication that will irritate or narrow your airways slightly if you have asthma. You'll then have a spirometry test to check if your breathing is affected. In some cases, exercise may be used as a trigger instead of medication. ","Peak flow test":"A peak flow test is a simple test to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath. It involves breathing out as quickly and as hard as you can into a small device called a peak flow meter. The result is compared to what's normal for someone of your age, height and gender. You may be given a peak flow meter to take home to record your peak flow over a period of weeks, particularly if asthma is suspected but your peak flow and spirometry are normal when measured, as asthma symptoms and peak flow can vary over time.  To help diagnose work-related asthma, you may be asked to measure your peak flow at work and away from work. Occasionally, you may be referred to a specialist doctor for further tests to confirm or rule out asthma. ","Testing airway inflammation":"Sometimes it's useful to check for inflammation in your airways. This can be done in two ways: a mucus sample \u2013 the doctor may take a sample of mucus (phlegm) so it can be tested for signs of inflammation nitric oxide concentration \u2013 as you breathe out, the level of nitric oxide in your breath is measured using a special machine; a high level of nitric oxide can be a sign of inflammation ","Allergy tests":"If your doctor thinks your symptoms may be triggered by an allergy, they may recommend allergy tests to find out what you're allergic to. Common allergy tests include: skin prick testing \u2013 a small sample of the substance you may be allergic to (an allergen) is pricked gently under the skin: if you're allergic, a small blister develops within 15 minutes a blood test \u2013 a sample of your blood is checked for substances that are produced by your body in response to an allergen Tests can also be carried out to see if you are allergic or sensitive to substances known to cause work-related asthma.

But it's important to ensure the school has up-to-date written information about your child's asthma medicines, how much they take, and when they need to take them. You may also need to supply the school with a spare reliever inhaler for your child to use if they experience symptoms during the school day. Staff at the school should be able to recognise worsening asthma symptoms and know what to do in the event of an attack, particularly staff supervising sport or physical education. Your child's school may have an asthma policy in place, which you can ask to see. Want to know more? Asthma UK: asthma at school and nursery ","Regular reviews and monitoring show":"You'll have regular contact with your care team to monitor your condition. These appointments may involve: talking about your symptoms \u2013 such as whether they're affecting your normal activities or are getting worse a discussion about your medication \u2013 including whether you think you might be experiencing any side effects and whether you need to be reminded how to use your inhaler correctly breathing tests It's also a good opportunity to ask any questions you have or raise any other issues you'd like to discuss with your doctor or asthma nurse. You may be asked to help monitor your condition between appointments. For example, you may be advised to check your peak flow reading if you think your symptoms may be getting worse. Your personal action plan should say what to do if your symptoms get gradually or suddenly worse. Contact your doctor or asthma nurse if you're not sure what to do. ","URL":"/conditions/Asthma","Looking after yourself hide":"It's important to take any prescribed medication regularly, as this can help keep your symptoms under control and prevent severe asthma attacks. It's also important to use any inhalers and spacers you may have been prescribed properly. Make sure your GP or practice nurse shows you how to use your inhalers correctly. Check with your doctor or asthma nurse if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers or nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with your medication. Some common medicines, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, may not be suitable if you have asthma. Always check the label or packet and ask a pharmacist, doctor or nurse if you're not sure. Speak to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have any concerns about the medication you're taking, or if you're experiencing any side effects. If you have asthma and you smoke, stopping smoking can significantly reduce how severe and frequent your symptoms are. If you think you need help to stop smoking, you can contact NHS Smokefree for free advice and support. You may also want to talk to your GP about the stop smoking medications available. Read more about stop smoking support or find a stop smoking service near you. Exercising regularly is as important for people with asthma as everyone else. Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week, such as fast walking or cycling. Although exercise can sometimes trigger your symptoms, this shouldn't happen once you're on appropriate treatment. If you or your child has symptoms during or after exercise, speak to your doctor or asthma nurse. They may consider updating your personal asthma plan to help you keep your symptoms under control. You may also be advised to: make sure the people you are exercising with know you have asthma always have your reliever inhaler with you when you exercise use your reliever inhaler immediately before you warm up ensure that you always warm up and down thoroughly If you have symptoms while you're exercising, stop what you're doing, take your reliever inhaler and wait until you feel better before starting again. Read about health and fitness for more information on simple ways to exercise. Most people with asthma can eat a normal, healthy diet. Along with regular exercise, this can help you maintain a healthy weight, which may help keep your asthma symptoms under control, as well as reduce your risk of other health problems. Some people may have food allergies that trigger their symptoms and will need to avoid these foods, but this is uncommon. Read more about good food and a healthy diet. It's important to identify possible asthma triggers by making a note of where you are and what you're doing when your symptoms get worse. Read about the causes of asthma for more about potential triggers. Some triggers, such as air pollution, illnesses and certain weather conditions, can be hard to avoid. But it may be possible to avoid other triggers, such as dust mites, fungal spores, pet fur and certain medications. See allergy prevention for more information. Speak to your doctor or asthma nurse for advice if you think you have identified a trigger for your symptoms. Certain infections can trigger your symptoms if you have asthma. Everyone with asthma is encouraged to have the annual flu jab and the one-off pneumococcal vaccination. You can get these vaccinations at your GP surgery or a local pharmacy that offers a vaccination service. Asthma symptoms are often worse at night. You might wake up some nights coughing or with a tight chest. If your child has asthma, poor sleep can affect their behaviour and concentration, as well as their ability to learn. Effectively controlling asthma with the treatment your doctor or nurse recommends should help. But speak to them if you're having trouble getting to sleep. Want to know more?

Your anaesthetist will tell you about any side effects you may experience after having a specific type of anaesthetic, and measures that will be taken to reduce these.  Some common side effects that can occur after having a general anaesthetic and some regional anaesthetics include: feeling sick or vomiting dizziness and feeling faint feeling cold or shivering headache itchiness bruising and soreness difficulty passing urine aches and pains The side effects of anaesthetic don't usually last very long and, if necessary, some of them can be treated. Tell the healthcare professionals treating you if you experience any of the above side effects or if you're in pain after your procedure. ","More information":"The Royal College of Anaesthetists has more information about anaesthesia. You can also find out more about specific types of anaesthesia by reading: local anaesthetic  general anaesthetic  epidural anaesthesia  Page last reviewed: 30/06/2015 Next review due: 01/06/2018 ","Introduction ":"Anaesthesia means \"loss of sensation\". Medications that cause anaesthesia are called anaesthetics. Anaesthetics are used during tests and surgical operations to numb sensation in certain areas of the body or induce sleep. This prevents pain and discomfort, and enables a wide range of medical procedures to be carried out. Local anaesthetics and general anaesthetics are two commonly used types of anaesthetics. A local anaesthetic is often used during minor procedures where a small area of the body is numbed and you remain fully conscious. A general anaesthetic is often used for more serious operations where you're totally unconscious and unaware of the procedure. ","How anaesthetics work":"Anaesthetics work by stopping the nerve signals that keep you awake and aware from reaching your brain. During this state of induced sleep, procedures can be carried out without you feeling anything. After the anaesthetic has worn off, the nerve signals will be able to reach your brain, and consciousness and feeling will return. ","Risks and complications":"In recent years, having anaesthesia has become very safe. Advances in equipment, medication and training mean serious problems are rare. However, as with any type of surgery or medical procedure, there's a potential risk of complications. The benefits and risks of surgery and anaesthesia will be carefully weighed up and explained to you before you have any operation. Very rare possible complications include: permanent nerve damage \u2013 this can cause numbness or paralysis (inability to move a part of the body), although this may be a result of the surgery itself; peripheral nerve damage occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 anaesthetics (the peripheral nerves run between the spinal cord and the rest of the body) an allergic reaction to an anaesthetic medication (anaphylaxis) \u2013 although this can be severe, appropriate treatment is on hand to enable the best chance of dealing with this effectively and immediately; it's not clear exactly how often anaesthetics cause anaphylaxis, but the best estimate is that a life-threatening allergic reaction occurs during 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000 anaesthetics death \u2013 there are approximately 10 deaths for every million anaesthetics given in the UK Your risk of developing complications will depend on a number of factors, including:  your medical history \u2013 for example, whether you have any other serious medical conditions or illnesses personal factors \u2013 for example, whether you smoke or are overweight; if you smoke, stopping several weeks before your operation will reduce your risk of having breathing problems, and losing weight will also help reduce your risk the type of procedure \u2013 for example, whether it's a planned or an emergency procedure, or whether it's a major or minor procedure the type of anaesthetic \u2013 local anaesthesia can have advantages over general anaesthetics in the right circumstances Before your procedure, your anaesthetist will explain if there are any particular risks of developing possible complications. In most cases, the benefits outweigh the risks. Any concerns you have should be discussed with your anaesthetist before surgery. ","How anaesthetics are given":"An anaesthetic can be given in a number of ways: as an ointment, spray or drops as an injection into a vein as a gas you breathe in ","Anaesthetists":"Anaesthetists are doctors who have received specialist training in anaesthesia. They'll give you your anaesthetic and be responsible for your safety and wellbeing during your procedure. Before the procedure, your anaesthetist will discuss a number of things with you, including: the types of anaesthetic appropriate for the procedure you're having any risks or side effects associated with different types of anaesthetic They'll plan your anaesthetic and pain control with you, taking into account any preferences you have for a particular type of anaesthetic. You should ask your anaesthetist to clarify anything you're unsure about. Your anaesthetist will carefully monitor you throughout your operation and make sure you wake up comfortably afterwards. They may also help with any pain relief you might need after the procedure. ","URL":"/conditions/Anaesthesia","Types of anaesthesia":"As well as local and general anaesthetic, there are a number of other types of anaesthesia. Unlike general anaesthetic, these don't make you unconscious; they stop you feeling pain in a particular area of your body. The different types of anaesthetic are described below.  regional anaesthetic \u2013 this is a local anaesthetic given to a specific region of your body, giving numbness or pain relief for deeper operations where more extensive numbness is needed epidural anaesthesia \u2013 a type of regional anaesthetic usually used to numb the lower half of the body; for example, as pain relief during labour and childbirth spinal anaesthetic \u2013 a type of regional anaesthetic used to give total numbness lasting about three hours to the lower parts of the body so surgery can be safely carried out in this area sedation \u2013 medication that makes you feel sleepy and relaxes you both physically and mentally; it's sometimes used to keep you calm during minor, painful or unpleasant procedures Different types of anaesthesia can be used in combination. For example, a regional anaesthetic can be used with a general anaesthetic to relieve pain after an operation. A sedative is also sometimes used with a regional anaesthetic to help you feel relaxed and calm during an operation, as well as pain-free.  "},"Title":"Anaesthesia"},"Animal bites":{"Introduction":{" ":"Serious animal and human bites can get infected if they're not checked and treated quickly. Always seek medical advice if you've been bitten by an animal or person and the bite has broken the skin. People and animals have a lot of bacteria in their mouths, which can cause an infection if a bite breaks the skin. These infections are rarely serious if treated quickly, but occasionally they can spread to the blood or other parts of the body. Serious infections such as tetanus and rabies are extremely rare in the UK, but it's important to get serious bites looked at as treatment to prevent these infections may be recommended. The following information is about bites by people and animals such as dogs and cats. There are separate pages on insect bites and snake bites. This page covers: What to do if you've been bitten When to get medical advice Signs that a bite may be infected Common causes of bites How to avoid animal bites If you've been bitten by an animal or another person: clean the wound immediately by running warm tap water over it for a couple of minutes \u2013 it's a good idea to do this even if the skin doesn't appear to be broken remove any objects from the bite, such as teeth, hair or dirt encourage the wound to bleed slightly by gently squeezing it, unless it's already bleeding freely if the wound is bleeding heavily, put a clean pad or sterile dressing over it and apply pressure dry the wound and cover it with a clean dressing or plaster take painkillers if you're in pain, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 years old shouldn't take aspirin seek medical advice, unless the wound is very minor If the bite has severed a body part like a finger or ear, wash it with tap water, wrap it in clean tissue, and store it in a plastic bag surrounded by ice so it can be transported to hospital. It may be possible to surgically reattach the body part later on. If the bite has broken the skin, you should seek immediate medical attention after cleaning the wound. Don't delay seeking help until symptoms of infection appear. Minor bites can be treated at your GP surgery, or by staff at your local walk-in centre or minor injuries unit. For particularly severe bites, visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department. The healthcare professional treating you may: clean the wound and remove any damaged tissue prescribe a course of antibiotics to prevent infection recommend specific treatment to prevent infections such as tetanus if you're felt to be at risk close the wound with stitches if the risk of infection is thought to be low \u2013 high-risk wounds will usually be left open as this means they're easier to keep clean arrange blood tests to check for infection, or an X-ray to check for any damage to your bones and see if there's anything embedded in your wound, such as a tooth refer you for an assessment by a specialist if the bite penetrated a joint, or there's severe damage, such as damage to bones or nerves \u2013 surgery may be needed in these cases if you're bitten by a person with hepatitis or HIV, there's a tiny chance of the infection spreading if the bite is contaminated with blood, so you may be offered treatment to stop you becoming infected When you return home, watch out for signs of a possible infection. Symptoms that suggest a wound has become infected include: redness and swelling around the wound the wound feels warm and increasingly painful liquid or pus leaks from the wound a fever of 38C (100.4F) or above sweats and chills swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin red streaks extending along the skin from the wound Get medical help as soon as possible if you think your wound is infected. Although you may be more worried about bites from wild and stray animals, any animal has the potential to bite. Many bites are actually caused by a person's own pet or an animal belonging to a friend or neighbour. Animals can act unpredictably and bites aren't always provoked. However, an animal is more likely to bite if it's been disturbed, feels threatened, or gets overexcited. Most human bites occur when one person punches another person in the mouth. They can also happen during contact sports, vigorous sex, domestic violence or sexual assault, and fits (seizures). Most animal bites are caused by dogs. The advice below may help reduce the chances of being bitten: never leave a young child unsupervised with a dog \u2013 regardless of what type of dog it is and its previous behaviour treat dogs with respect \u2013 don't approach them suddenly, run around screaming in their presence, or interrupt them when they're eating or sleeping avoid stroking or petting unfamiliar dogs \u2013 when greeting a dog for the first time, let it sniff you before petting it It's also a good idea to avoid contact with any wild or stray animals, particularly while travelling abroad, as they can be aggressive and there's a chance they could carry serious infections, such as rabies.

A person with Angelman syndrome will have a near-normal life expectancy, but needs looking after for the rest of their life. This page covers: Characteristics Causes Diagnosis Managing the condition Help and support The typical characteristics of Angelman syndrome aren't usually apparent at birth. A child with Angelman syndrome will begin to show signs of delayed development at around 6-12 months, such as being unable to sit unsupported or make babbling noises. Later, they may not speak at all or may only be able to say a few words. However, most children with Angelman syndrome will be able to communicate using gestures, signs or other systems. The movement of a child with Angelman syndrome will also be affected. They may have difficulty walking because of problems with balance and co-ordination (ataxia). Their arms may tremble or move jerkily, and their legs may be stiffer than normal. A number of distinctive behaviours are associated with Angelman syndrome. These include: frequent laughter and smiling, often with little stimulus being easily excitable, often flapping the hands being restless (hyperactive) having a short attention span problems sleeping and needing less sleep than other children a particular fascination with water By around two years of age, an abnormally small head which is flat at the back (microbrachycephaly) will be noticeable in some children with Angelman syndrome. Children with Angelman syndrome may also start to have seizures (fits) around this age. Other possible features of the syndrome include: tendency to stick the tongue out crossed eyes (strabismus) pale skin, and light-coloured hair and eyes in some children a wide mouth with widely spaced teeth a side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) walking with arms in the air Some young babies with Angelman syndrome may have problems feeding because they're unable to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing. In such cases, a high-calorie formula may be recommended to help the baby gain weight. Babies with Angelman syndrome may need to be treated for reflux. In most cases of Angelman syndrome, the child's parents don't have the condition and the genetic difference responsible for the syndrome occurs by chance around the time of conception. The typical characteristics of Angelman syndrome are caused when the Angelman gene, known as UBE3A, is either absent or malfunctions. A gene is a single unit of genetic material (DNA) which acts as an instruction for the way an individual is made and develops. A child usually inherits one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies are switched on (active) in most of the body's tissues. However, in certain areas of the brain, only the gene inherited from the mother is active. In most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70%), the child's maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is missing (deleted), which means there's no active copy of the UBE3A gene in the child's brain. In around 11% of cases, the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is present but altered (mutated).  In a small number of cases, Angelman syndrome occurs when a child inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the father, rather than inheriting one from each parent. This is known as uniparental disomy.  It can also occur when the copy of the UBE3A gene that comes from the mother behaves like it came from the father. This is known as an \"imprinting defect\". In about 5-10% of cases, the cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown. Most children in these unexplained cases have different conditions involving other genes or chromosomes. Angelman syndrome may be suspected if a child's development is delayed and they have the syndrome's distinctive characteristics (see above). A blood sample can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. A number of genetic tests will be carried out on the sample. These may include: chromosome analysis \u2013 to see if any parts of the chromosomes are missing (deletions) fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) \u2013 used to check specifically for chromosome 15 deletions when Angelman syndrome is suspected, or to check the mother's chromosomes DNA methylation \u2013 which shows whether the genetic material on both the mother's and father's chromosomes is active UBE3A gene mutation analysis \u2013 used to see if the genetic code on the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is altered For each child with Angelman syndrome, it's important to know the genetic change that caused the condition. This helps to determine whether there's a risk of it occurring again in another child, or whether there are implications for other members of the family. Most children with Angelman syndrome are diagnosed between the ages of 18 months and 6 years, when the typical physical and behavioural symptoms become apparent. If your child is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, you should be given the opportunity to discuss the genetic diagnosis and implications with a genetic doctor. Some of the symptoms of Angelman syndrome can be difficult to manage, and you're likely to need help from a wide range of different healthcare professionals. Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids: anti-epileptic medicine to control the seizures \u2013 sodium valproate and clonazepam are some of the most commonly prescribed medicines and ketogenic diets have also been used physiotherapy may help to improve posture, balance and walking ability; it's also important to prevent permanent stiffening (contractures) of the joints as people with Angelman syndrome get older a back brace or spinal surgery may be recommended to prevent the spine from becoming more curved (see treating scoliosis) an ankle or foot orthosis (lower leg brace) may be recommended to help with walking independently communication therapy may be needed to help them develop non-verbal language skills, such as sign language and using visual aids; using iPad applications and similar tablet devices may also help behavioural therapy may be recommended to help overcome problem behaviours, hyperactivity and a short attention span activities such as swimming, horseriding and music therapy have also been reported as being beneficial Read more about:  Caring for a disabled child Carers' wellbeing While there's currently no cure for Angelman syndrome, the results of preliminary genetic research have been promising. Following these studies, scientists believe it may be possible to restore UBE3A function in the brains of people with Angelman syndrome at some stage in the future. There are also clinical trials looking at treatment for some of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome, such as treatments for seizures. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less hyperactive and the sleeping problems tend to improve. Most people with the syndrome will have intellectual disability and limited speech throughout their life. In later childhood, the seizures usually improve, although they may return in adulthood. In adults, some mobility may be lost and joints may stiffen up. People with Angelman syndrome usually have good general health, are often able to improve their communication and acquire new skills throughout their lives. The Angelman Syndrome Support Education and Research Trust (ASSERT) is a UK based charity providing information and support for parents and carers of people with the syndrome. As well as visiting the website, you can also call the charity's helpline on 0300 999 0102 to speak with parents of people with Angelman syndrome, who can offer you help and advice.  If your child has Angelman syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

There are four main types, but type 1, called Chiari I, is the most common. In someone with Chiari I, the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal. This can put pressure on the brainstem, spinal cord, and obstruct the flow of fluid. This page focuses on Chiari I malformations. Is it serious? Symptoms Treatments Causes The severity of Chiari malformations can vary from person to person, but generally: Chiari I malformations aren't considered life-threatening some people experience painful headaches, movement problems and other unpleasant symptoms (see below), but many people won't have any symptoms  there's a chance of developing syringomyelia (where a fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx develops in the spinal cord), which can damage the spinal cord if not treated promptly surgery can usually stop the symptoms getting worse and can sometimes improve them, although some problems may remain Talk to your doctor about what the condition means, what the implications may be for your health and what treatment you may need. Many people with a Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. Sometimes they're only found after an (MRI) scan of the brain is carried out for another reason. If symptoms do develop, they can include: headaches \u2013 these are usually felt at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over neck pain dizziness and balance problems muscle weakness numbness or tingling in the arms or legs blurred vision, double vision and sensitivity to light swallowing problems hearing loss and tinnitus feeling and being sick difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression If you develop syringomyelia, you may also experience problems using your hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control. If you've been diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, you should contact your doctor for advice if you develop any new symptoms or your symptoms worsen. Treatment for Chiari I malformation depends on whether you have any symptoms and how severe they are. You might not need any treatment if you don't have any symptoms. Painkillers can help relieve any headaches and neck pain. If your headaches are severe or you have problems caused by the pressure on your spinal cord (such as movement difficulties), surgery may be recommended. ","Surgery":"The main operation for Chiari malformation is called decompression surgery. Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine. This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally. Read an NHS leaflet about decompression for Chiari malformation (PDF, 111kb). Other procedures that may be necessary include: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) \u2013 a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting \u2013 a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Untethering \u2013 some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine. Read an NHS leaflet on tethered spinal cord (PDF, 193kb). Spinal fixation \u2013 some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and may require surgery to stabilise their spine. The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches. However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke. Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are. The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done. Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain. Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), and some types of brain tumour. Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development. But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small. And remember: even if your children do inherit it, they may not experience symptoms.

It's particularly important to follow this advice if you've had a bad reaction to an insect bite or sting in the past or you're travelling to an area where there's a risk of picking up a serious illness. This page covers: Basic precautions to prevent insect bites and stings Avoiding tick bites Extra precautions when travelling abroad Insect infestations The following measures can help you avoid insect bites and stings: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin \u2013 if you're outside at a time of day when insects are particularly active, such as sunrise or sunset, cover your skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. Never disturb insect nests \u2013 if a nest is in your house or garden, arrange to have it removed (GOV.UK has details about pest control services and how your local council can help). Avoid camping near water, such as ponds and swamps \u2013 mosquitoes and horseflies are commonly found near water. Keep food and drink covered when eating or drinking outside, particularly sweet things \u2013 wasps or bees can also get into open drink bottles or cans you're drinking from. Keep doors and windows closed or put thin netting or door beads over them to prevent insects getting inside the house \u2013 also keep the windows of your car closed to stop insects getting inside. Ticks are small spider-like creatures that are mainly found in woodland and heath areas. They attach to your skin, suck your blood and can cause Lyme disease in some cases. You can reduce your risk of being bitten by a tick if you: Keep to footpaths and avoiding long grass when out walking. Wear appropriate clothing in tick-infested areas (a long-sleeved shirt and trousers tucked into your socks). Wear light-coloured fabrics that may help you spot a tick on your clothes. Use insect repellent on exposed skin. Inspect your skin for ticks, particularly at the end of the day, including your head, neck and skin folds (armpits, groin, and waistband). Check your children's head and neck areas, including their scalp making sure ticks are not brought home on your clothes. Check your pets to help ensure they don't bring ticks into your home in their fur. It's important to remove any ticks you find as soon as possible. Find out how to safely remove a tick. The risk of becoming seriously ill from an insect bite or sting in the UK is small, but in some parts of the world insects can carry serious diseases such as malaria and you need to be extra careful. In addition to the precautions mentioned above, it can help to: Find out what the risks are where you intend to travel \u2013 use the country guide on NHS Fit for Travel. Check if you need any vaccinations before travelling \u2013 vaccines can prevent some illnesses spread by insects, such as yellow fever. Check NHS Fit for Travel for advice about specific destinations. Speak to your GP about any extra precautions and medication you might need to take \u2013 for example, if you're visiting an area where there's a risk of malaria, you may be advised to bring a mosquito net and take antimalarial tablets to avoid malaria. Read more about travel illnesses and vaccinations. If you've been bitten by fleas, mites or bedbugs, you may have an infestation in your home. Try to find the source of the infestation before taking steps to eliminate it. ","Eliminating an infestation":"Once you've identified the cause of the infestation, you'll need to eliminate it. For flea infestations, treat the animal, its bedding, household carpets and soft furnishings with an insecticide. Thoroughly vacuum your carpets and soft furnishings. For mite infestations, you should seek advice from your vet as aggressive treatment is required. For bedbug infestations, your home will need to be thoroughly treated with an insecticide by a reputable pest control company.

This page covers: First aid for insect bites and stings Removing a sting Removing a tick Dealing with caterpillar hairs Relieving the symptoms of an insect bite or sting When to get medical advice When to get emergency help To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting, tick or hairs if still in the skin (see below for advice about how to do this safely).  Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area or bursting any blisters, to reduce the risk of infection \u2013 if your child has been bitten or stung, it may help to keep their fingernails short and clean. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. See below for advice about how to relieve the symptoms of an insect bite or sting in the meantime. If you've been stung and the sting has been left in your skin, you should remove it as soon as possible to prevent any more venom being released. Scrape it out sideways with something with a hard edge, such as a bank card, or your fingernails if you don't have anything else to hand. Don't pinch the sting with your fingers or tweezers because you may spread the venom. If you've been bitten by a tick and it's still attached to your skin, remove it as soon as possible to reduce your risk of picking up illnesses such as Lyme disease. To remove a tick: Use a pair of tweezers that won't squash the tick (such as fine-tipped tweezers) or a tick removal tool (available from pet shops or vets). Grip the tick as close to the skin as possible to ensure the tick's mouth isn't left in the skin. Pull steadily away from the skin without crushing the tick. Wash your skin with water and soap afterwards, then apply an antiseptic cream to the skin around the bite. If you use a tick removal tool follow the manufacturer's instructions. Don't use a lit cigarette end, a match head or substances such as alcohol or petroleum jelly to force the tick out. If a caterpillar of the oak processionary moth gets on your skin: Use tweezers or a pen to remove it. Try not to disturb it (for example, by brushing it with your hands) as it will then release more hairs. Rinse your skin with running water, allow it to air dry and then use sticky tape to strip off any leftover hairs. Use calamine, ice packs or a pharmacy remedy containing 3.5% ammonia to relieve the itch. Remove all contaminated clothes and wash at as a high a temperature as the fabric allows. Don't towel yourself dry after rinsing or use creams containing antihistamine. If you have troublesome symptoms after an insect bite or sting, the following treatments may help: For pain or discomfort \u2013 take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin). For itching \u2013 ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments, including crotamiton cream or lotion, hydrocortisone cream or ointment and antihistamine tablets. For swelling \u2013 try regularly applying a cold compress or ice pack to the affected area, or ask your pharmacist about treatments such as antihistamine tablets. See your GP if these treatments don't help. They may prescribe stronger medicines such as steroid tablets.

Other symptoms of dysentery can include: painful stomach cramps nausea or vomiting a fever of 38C (100.4F) or above Dysentery is highly infectious and can be passed on if you don't take the right precautions, such as properly and regularly washing your hands (see below). This page covers: Types Treatment How to avoid spreading it When to see your GP Reducing your risk Causes There are two main types of dysentery: bacillary dysentery or shigellosis \u2013 caused by shigella bacteria; this is the most common type of dysentery in the UK amoebic dysentery or amoebiasis \u2013 caused by an amoeba (single-celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica, which is mainly found in tropical areas; this type of dysentery is usually picked up abroad As dysentery usually clears up on its own after three to seven days, treatment isn't usually needed. However, it's important to drink plenty of fluids and use oral rehydration solutions (ORS) if necessary to avoid dehydration. Over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, can help relieve pain and a fever. Avoid antidiarrhoeal medications, such as loperamide, because they can make things worse. You should stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. Handwashing is the most important way to stop the spread of infection. You're infectious to other people while you're ill and have symptoms. Take the following steps to avoid passing the illness on to others: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after going to the toilet. Read more about how to wash your hands. Stay away from work or school until you've been completely free from any symptoms for at least 48 hours. Help young children to wash their hands properly. Don't prepare food for others until you've been symptom free for at least 48 hours. Don't go swimming until you've been symptom free for at least 48 hours. Where possible, stay away from other people until your symptoms have stopped. Wash all dirty clothes, bedding and towels on the hottest possible cycle of the washing machine. Clean toilet seats and toilet bowls, and flush handles, taps and sinks with detergent and hot water after use, followed by a household disinfectant. Avoid sexual contact until you've been symptom free for at least 48 hours. As shigella is easily passed on to others, you may need to submit stool (poo) samples to be given the all clear to return to work, school, nursery or a childminder. The type of shigella you have and whether or not you or others are in a risk group will influence how long you need to stay away.  Risk groups are people in certain occupations \u2013 including healthcare workers and people who handle food \u2013 as well as people who need help with personal hygiene and very young children. Your environmental health officer will be able to advise you about this. It's not always necessary to see your GP if you have dysentery because it tends to clear up within a week or so. However, you should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or they don't start to improve after a few days. Let them know if you've been abroad recently. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics. If you have very severe dysentery, you may need treatment in hospital for a few days. You can reduce your risk of getting dysentery by: washing your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet and regularly throughout the day washing your hands before handling, eating or cooking food avoiding sharing towels washing the laundry of an infected person on the hottest setting possible Read more about food safety and home hygiene. If you're travelling to a country where there's a high risk of getting dysentery, the advice below can help prevent infection: Don't drink the local water unless you're sure it's clean (sterile) \u2013 drink bottled water or drinks in sealed cans or bottles. If the water isn't sterile, boil it for several minutes or use chemical disinfectant or a reliable filter. Don't clean your teeth with tap water. Don't have ice in your drinks because it may be made from unclean water. Avoid fresh fruit or vegetables that can't be peeled before eating. Avoid food and drink sold by street vendors, except drinks in properly sealed cans or bottles. Read more about food and water safety abroad. Bacillary and amoebic dysentery are both highly infectious and can be passed on if the faeces (poo) of an infected person gets into another person's mouth. This can happen if someone with the infection doesn't wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces or another person. In the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people in close contact, such as in families, schools and nurseries. There's also a chance of picking up the infection through anal or anal-oral sex (\"rimming\"). In developing countries with poor sanitation, infected faeces may contaminate the water supply or food, particularly cold uncooked food.

Make sure the food is cooked thoroughly and is steaming hot in the middle. To check that meat is cooked, insert a knife into the thickest or deepest part. It is fully cooked if the juices are clear and there is no pink or red meat. Some meat, such as steaks and joints of beef or lamb, can be served rare (not cooked in the middle), as long as the outside has been cooked properly. When reheating food, make sure it is steaming hot all the way through. Don't reheat food more than once. ","Cross-contamination":"Cross-contamination is when bacteria are transferred from foods (usually raw foods) to other foods. This can occur when one food touches or drips onto another food, or when bacteria on your hands, work surfaces, equipment or utensils are spread to food. To prevent cross-contamination: always wash your hands after handling raw food store raw and ready-to-eat foods separately store raw meat in sealable containers at the bottom of your fridge so that it cannot drip onto other foods use a different chopping board for raw food and ready-to-eat food, or wash it thoroughly in between preparing different types of food clean knives and other utensils thoroughly after using them with raw food do not wash raw meat or poultry \u2013 any harmful bacteria will be killed by thorough cooking, and washing may splash harmful bacteria around the kitchen ","Chilling":"Certain foods need to be kept at the correct temperature to prevent harmful bacteria from growing and multiplying. Always check the storage instructions on the label. If food has to be refrigerated, make sure your fridge is set to 0\u20135C (32\u201341F). If food that needs to be chilled is left at room temperature, bacteria can grow and multiply to dangerous levels. Cooked leftovers should be cooled quickly, ideally within a couple of hours, and put in your fridge or freezer. ","Cleaning":"You can prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and viruses by maintaining good personal hygiene standards and keeping work surfaces and utensils clean. Regularly wash your hands with soap and warm water, particularly: after going to the toilet or changing a baby's nappy before preparing food after handling raw food after touching bins or pets You shouldn't handle food if you are ill with stomach problems, such as diarrhoea or vomiting or you have any uncovered sores or cuts.

","URL":"/conditions/Food-poisoning"},"Causes":{"Types of infection":"Food contamination is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also sometimes be caused by viruses or parasites. Some of the main sources of contamination are described below. In the UK, campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk and untreated water. The incubation period (the time between eating contaminated food and the start of symptoms) for food poisoning caused by campylobacter is usually between two and five days. The symptoms usually last less than a week. Salmonella bacteria are often found in raw or undercooked meat, raw eggs, milk, and other dairy products. The incubation period is usually between 12 and 72 hours. The symptoms usually last around four to seven days. Read more about salmonella infections. Listeria bacteria may be found in a range of chilled, \"ready-to-eat\" foods, including pre-packed sandwiches, cooked sliced meats and pâté, and soft cheeses (such as Brie or Camembert). All of these foods should be eaten by their \"use-by\" dates. This is particularly important for pregnant women, because a listeria infection (known as listeriosis) in pregnancy can cause pregnancy and birth complications, and can result in miscarriage. The incubation period can vary considerably, from a few days to several weeks. The symptoms will usually pass within three days. Read more about listeriosis.  Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is typically one to eight days. The symptoms usually last for a few days or weeks. Shigella bacteria can contaminate any food that has been washed in contaminated water. Symptoms typically develop within seven days of eating contaminated food and last for up to a week. An infection caused by Shigella bacteria is known as bacillary dysentery or shigellosis. See the topic on dysentery for more information about it. The virus that most commonly causes diarrhoea and vomiting is the norovirus. It's easily spread from person to person, through contaminated food or water. Raw shellfish, particularly oysters, can also be a source of infection. The incubation period typically lasts 24-48 hours and the symptoms usually pass in a couple of days. In young children, the rotavirus is a common cause of infection from contaminated food. The symptoms usually develop within a week and pass in around five to seven days. In the UK, food poisoning caused by parasites is rare. It's much more common in the developing world. Parasitic infections that can be spread in contaminated food include: giardiasis \u2013 an infection caused by a parasite called Giardia intestinalis cryptosporidiosis \u2013 an infection caused by a parasite called Cryptosporidium ameobiasis \u2013 a type of dysentery caused by a single-cell parasite (ameoba) called Entamoeba histolytica (this is very rare in the UK) The symptoms of food poisoning caused by a parasite usually develop within 10 days of eating contaminated food, although sometimes it may be weeks before you feel unwell. If left untreated, the symptoms can last a long time \u2013 sometimes several weeks or even a few months.

Failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so you must: remember to collect your repeat prescriptions keep spare medication as necessary \u2013 for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you take your medication every day at the right time pack extra medication if you are going away \u2013 usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below) carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary You could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one. It's also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people you have Addison\u2019s disease. After a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you'll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis. Wearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff treating you about your condition, and what medication you require. Medical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there's one they recommend, or go to the MedicAlert website.  If you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It's important to note that this advice still applies if you're not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason. ","Free prescriptions":"If you're receiving treatment for Addison's disease, you're entitled to a medical exemption certificate. This means you don't have to pay for any prescriptions you need. See help with prescription costs for more information. Page last reviewed: 15/07/2015 Next review due: 01/07/2018 ","Emergency treatment":"You and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency. This could be necessary if you go into shock after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you're pregnant and have morning sickness. Your endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary. If you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always call your GP immediately afterwards. Check what out-of-hours services are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours. You can also register yourself with your local ambulance service, so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance. ","Medication for Addison\u2019s disease":"Treatment usually involves corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that your body no longer produces. It's usually taken in tablet form two or three times a day. In most cases, a medication called hydrocortisone is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.  Aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you're taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this may not be necessary. Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it. In general, the medications used for Addison's disease don't have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there's a risk of problems such as weakened bones (osteoporosis), mood swings and difficulty sleeping (insomnia). ","Treating adrenal crisis":"Adrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis. Signs of an adrenal crisis include: severe dehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing dizziness severe vomiting and diarrhoea severe muscle weakness headache severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness In hospital, you'll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You'll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone. Any underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated. ","Treating Addison's disease ":"If you have Addison\u2019s disease, you'll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue. In some cases, the underlying causes of Addison\u2019s disease can be treated. For example, tuberculosis (TB) is treated with a course of antibiotics over a period of at least six months. However, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can't be cured. ","URL":"/conditions/Addisons-disease","Adjusting your medication":"At certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following: an illness or infection \u2013 particularly if you have a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above an accident, such as a car crash an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy) you're taking part in strenuous exercise not usually part of your daily life This will help your body cope with the additional stress. Your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you're unsure. "},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Addison\u2019s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce two essential hormones: cortisol and aldosterone. In Addison's disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced. About 8,400 people in the UK have Addison's disease. It can affect people of any age, although it's most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It's also more common in women than men. Early-stage symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as depression or flu. You may experience: fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) muscle weakness low mood loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss increased thirst Over time, these problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, cramps and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums. Although these symptoms aren\u2019t always caused by Addison\u2019s disease, you should see your GP, so they can be investigated. Read more about the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease and diagnosing Addison\u2019s disease. ","Treating Addison's disease":"Addison\u2019s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take the medication for the rest of your life. With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life, with few limitations. However, many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid. People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly. An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison\u2019s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, dial 999 for an ambulance. Read more about treating Addison's disease. ","Information about you":"If you have Addison's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Page last reviewed: 15/07/2015 Next review due: 01/07/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Addisons-disease","Why it happens":"The condition is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70-90% of cases in the UK. Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis (TB), although this is uncommon in the UK. Read more about the causes of Addison\u2019s disease. "},"Causes":{"Problems with the immune system":"In the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison's disease, accounting for 70-90% of cases. The immune system is your body\u2019s defence against infection and disease. If you're ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness. However, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder. Addison\u2019s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won't be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you'll experience symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease. It's not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families (see below). ","Secondary adrenal insufficiency":"The production of hormones from the adrenal gland can also be affected by damage to the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland located below the brain), as the pituitary gland produces a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland. This is a separate condition to Addison's disease, known as secondary adrenal insufficiency. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can occur if your pituitary gland becomes damaged \u2013 for example, because of a tumour on the pituitary gland (known as pituitary adenomas). Page last reviewed: 15/07/2015 Next review due: 01/07/2018 ","Genetics":"Research has shown that some people with certain genes are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders. It's not clear how these genes lead to Addison's disease and similar conditions, but it does mean your risk of developing Addison's disease is increased if you or a close family member have another autoimmune condition, such as: vitiligo \u2013 a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin type 1 diabetes \u2013 a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood   underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)  ","Other causes":"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of Addison's disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body. It can cause Addison\u2019s disease if it damages your adrenal glands. Other possible causes of Addison\u2019s disease include: infections \u2013 such as those linked to AIDS, or fungal infections a haemorrhage \u2013 very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with meningitis or other types of severe sepsis cancer \u2013 if cancer cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands amyloidosis \u2013 a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them surgical removal of both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) \u2013 for example, to remove a tumour adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) \u2013 a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that most often affects young boys certain treatments needed for Cushing's syndrome \u2013 a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body ","URL":"/conditions/Addisons-disease","Causes of Addison's disease ":"Addison's disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces. "},"Title":"Addison's disease","Diagnosis":{"Diagnosis during an adrenal crisis":"If Addison\u2019s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. This is where the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease appear quickly and severely. During an adrenal crisis, there's not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm Addison\u2019s disease. If possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. While you're waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose. Read more about treating Addison\u2019s disease. ","Scans":"In some cases, your specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands \u2013 this could be a computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. ","Diagnosing Addison's disease ":"To help diagnose Addison\u2019s disease, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history. They're also likely to ask if anyone in your family has an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system). Your GP will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as: where skin creases on your palm in your elbow crease on any scars your lips and gums However, hyperpigmentation doesn't occur in all cases of Addison\u2019s disease. You'll also be tested for low blood pressure (hypotension) while you're lying down and again shortly after you stand up. This is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position). ","Blood tests":"If Addison\u2019s disease is suspected, blood tests will be carried out to measure the levels of sodium, potassium and cortisol in your body. A low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate Addison\u2019s disease. You may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood to be tested for the following: a low level of the hormone aldosterone a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy) positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland) Any of the above could be a sign of Addison\u2019s disease. ","Driving":"If you're diagnosed with Addison's disease and have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Read about driving and Addison's disease on the GOV.UK website. Page last reviewed: 15/07/2015 Next review due: 01/07/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Addisons-disease","Synacthen stimulation test":"If cortisol in your blood is low, or your symptoms strongly suggest Addison\u2019s disease, you'll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis. Your GP may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. How urgently you're referred depends on how severe your symptoms are. Synacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. When synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to ACTH, and release cortisol and other steroid hormones into the blood. A blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of synacthen is given into your arm. After 30 and 60 minutes, a further blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement. If the ACTH level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it's usually confirmation of Addison\u2019s disease. ","Thyroid function test":"As well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it's working properly. Your thyroid gland is found in your neck. It produces hormones that control your body's growth and metabolism. People with Addison\u2019s disease often have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. By testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism. "},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms of Addison's disease ":"Addison's disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions. Initial symptoms of Addison's disease can include: fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness) muscle weakness low mood (mild depression) or irritability loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss the need to urinate frequently increased thirst craving for salty foods Dehydration can also be an early sign of Addison\u2019s disease. It's caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water. ","Later symptoms":"Further symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However, additional stress, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse. You may go on to develop: low blood pressure when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting  feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea abdominal, joint or back pain muscle cramps  chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression brownish discolouration of the skin, lips and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees a reduced libido (lack of interest in sex), particularly in women Some women may also have irregular periods or miss some periods completely. Children with Addison's disease may experience puberty later than usual. Some people with Addison's disease also develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). This can cause symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children). If you're experiencing symptoms of Addison's disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition. These symptoms will usually improve with appropriate treatment. Read more about diagnosing Addison's disease and treating Addison's disease. ","URL":"/conditions/Addisons-disease","Adrenal crisis":"If Addison\u2019s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation called an adrenal or Addisonian crisis. During an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease appear quickly and severely. This could happen when you're already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all. Signs of an adrenal crisis include: severe dehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing dizziness severe vomiting and diarrhoea severe muscle weakness headache severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know with Addison\u2019s disease is having an adrenal crisis, dial 999 for an ambulance. If an adrenal crisis isn't treated, it can lead to a coma and death. There's also a risk your brain won't get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which can cause permanent disability.

Find your local clinical commissioning group (CCG). There are three main types of fertility treatment: medicines  surgical procedures  assisted conception \u2013 including intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF)  This page also covers: Eligibility for NHS treatment Going private Fertility medicines are usually prescribed to women as they are mostly used to help with ovulation problems. But, in some cases, they may also be prescribed to men.  Common fertility medicines include: clomifene \u2013 encourages the monthly release of an egg (ovulation) in women who don't ovulate regularly or who can't ovulate at all tamoxifen \u2013 an alternative to clomifene that may be offered to women with ovulation problems metformin \u2013 particularly beneficial for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) gonadotrophins \u2013 can help stimulate ovulation in women, and may also improve fertility in men gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and dopamine agonists \u2013 other types of medication prescribed to encourage ovulation Some of these medicines may cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches and hot flushes. Speak to your doctor for more information about the possible side effects of specific medicines. Medication that stimulates the ovaries isn't recommended for women with unexplained infertility because it hasn't been found to increase their chances of getting pregnant. Surgical procedures that may be used to investigate fertility problems and help with fertility are outlined below. ","Correcting an epididymal blockage and surgery to retrieve sperm":"The epididymis is a coil-like structure in the testicles that helps store and transport sperm. Sometimes the epididymis becomes blocked, preventing sperm being ejaculated normally. If this is causing infertility, surgery can be used to correct the blockage. Surgical extraction of sperm may be an option for men: with an obstruction that prevents the release of sperm born without the tube that drains the sperm from the testicle (vas deferens) who've had a vasectomy or a failed vasectomy reversal Both operations take a few hours and are carried out under local anaesthetic as outpatient procedures. You'll be advised on the same day about the quality of the tissue or sperm collected. Any sperm will be frozen and placed in storage for use at a later stage. ","Endometriosis, fibroids and PCOS":"Endometriosis is when parts of the womb lining start growing outside the womb. Laparoscopic surgery is often used for women who have endometriosis to destroy or remove fluid-filled sacs called cysts. It may also be used to remove submucosal fibroids, which are small growths in the womb. In women with PCOS, a minor surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling can be used if ovulation medication hasn't worked. This involves using either heat or a laser to destroy part of the ovary. Read more about laparoscopy. ","In vitro fertilisation (IVF)":"In IVF, the egg is fertilised outside the body. The woman takes fertility medication to encourage her ovaries to produce more eggs than normal. Eggs are removed from her ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. A fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. Read more about IVF. ","Fallopian tube surgery":"If your fallopian tubes have become blocked or scarred, you may need surgery to repair the tubes. Surgery can be used to break up the scar tissue in your fallopian tubes, making it easier for eggs to pass along them. The success of surgery will depend on the extent of the damage to your fallopian tubes. Possible complications from tubal surgery include an ectopic pregnancy, when the fertilised egg implants outside the womb. ","Choosing a clinic":"If you decide to go private, you can ask your GP for advice. Make sure you choose a clinic licensed by the HFEA. The HFEA is a government organisation that regulates and inspects all UK clinics that provide fertility treatment, including the storage of eggs, sperm or embryos. There's no evidence to suggest complementary therapies for fertility problems are effective. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states further research is needed before such interventions can be recommended.  Page last reviewed: 14/02/2017 Next review due: 14/02/2020 ","Intrauterine insemination (IUI)":"IUI, also known as artificial insemination, involves inserting sperm into the womb via a fine plastic tube passed through the cervix. Sperm is first collected and washed in a fluid. The best-quality specimens \u2013 the fastest moving \u2013 are selected. Read more about IUI. ","URL":"/conditions/Infertility","Egg and sperm donation":"If you or your partner has an infertility problem, you may be able to receive eggs or sperm from a donor to help you conceive. Treatment with donor eggs is usually carried out using IVF. Anyone who registered to donate eggs or sperm after April 1 2005 can no longer remain anonymous and has to provide information about their identity. This is because a child born as a result of donated eggs or sperm is legally entitled to find out the identity of the donor when they become an adult (at age 18). More on treatments for infertility Get more information on fertility treatment options on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) website. Fertility treatment funded by the NHS varies across the UK. Waiting lists for treatment can be very long in some areas. The eligibility criteria can also vary. Your GP will be able to advise about your eligibility for treatment, or you can contact your local clinical commissioning group (CCG). If your GP refers you to a specialist for further tests, the NHS will pay for this. All patients have the right to be referred to an NHS clinic for the initial investigation. If you have an infertility problem, you may want to consider private treatment. This can be expensive, and there's no guarantee of success. It's important to choose a private clinic carefully. You should find out: which clinics are available which treatments are offered the success rates of treatments the length of the waiting list the costs Ask for a personalised, fully costed treatment plan that explains exactly what's included, such as fees, scans and any necessary medication. "},"Introduction":{" ":"Infertility is when a couple can't get pregnant (conceive), despite having regular unprotected sex. Around one in seven couples may have difficulty conceiving. This is approximately 3.5 million people in the UK. About 84% of couples will conceive naturally within one year if they have regular unprotected sex (every two or three days). For couples who've been trying to conceive for more than three years without success, the likelihood of getting pregnant naturally within the next year is 25% or less. This page covers: Getting help Treatment Causes Some women get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It's a good idea to see your GP if you haven't conceived after one year of trying. Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who's already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner. Your GP can check for common causes of fertility problems and suggest treatments that could help. Infertility is only usually diagnosed when a couple haven't managed to conceive after one year of trying. There are two types of infertility: primary infertility \u2013 where someone who's never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceiving secondary infertility \u2013 where someone has had one or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving again Read more about how infertility is diagnosed. Fertility treatments include: medical treatment \u2013 for lack of regular ovulation surgical procedures \u2013 such as treatment for endometriosis, repair of the fallopian tubes, or removal of scarring (adhesions) within the womb or abdominal cavity   assisted conception \u2013 this may be intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) The treatment offered will depend on what's causing your fertility problems and what's available from your local clinical commissioning group (CCG). Private treatment is also available, but it can be expensive and there's no guarantee it will be successful. It's important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask your GP for advice, and should make sure you choose a clinic that's licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Read more about how infertility is treated. Some treatments for infertility, such as IVF, can cause complications. For example: multiple pregnancy \u2013 if more than one embryo is placed in the womb as part of IVF treatment, there's an increased chance of having twins; this may not seem like a bad thing, but it significantly increases the risk of complications for you and your babies ectopic pregnancy \u2013 the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly increased if you have IVF There are many possible causes of infertility, and fertility problems can affect either the man or the woman. However, in a quarter of cases it isn't possible to identify the cause. In women, common causes of infertility include: lack of regular ovulation, the monthly release of an egg blocked or damaged fallopian tubes endometriosis \u2013 where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb (the endometrium) is found outside the womb In men, the most common cause of infertility is poor-quality semen. ","URL":"/conditions/Infertility","Risk factors":"There are also a number of factors that can affect fertility in both men and women. These include: age \u2013 female fertility and, to a lesser extent, male fertility decline with age; in women, the biggest decrease in fertility begins during the mid-30s weight \u2013 being overweight or obese (having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or over) reduces fertility; in women, being overweight or severely underweight can affect ovulation sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 several STIs, including chlamydia, can affect fertility smoking \u2013 can affect fertility in both sexes: smoking (including passive smoking) affects a woman's chance of conceiving, while in men there's an association between smoking and reduced semen quality; read more about quitting smoking alcohol \u2013 for women planning to get pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum; for men, drinking too much alcohol can affect the quality of sperm (the chief medical officers for the UK recommend men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over three days or more) environmental factors \u2013 exposure to certain pesticides, solvents and metals has been shown to affect fertility, particularly in men  stress \u2013 can affect your relationship with your partner and cause a loss of sex drive; in severe cases, stress may also affect ovulation and sperm production There's no evidence to suggest caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee and colas, are associated with fertility problems.

Some problems stop an egg being released at all, while others prevent an egg being released during some cycles but not others. Ovulation problems can be a result of:  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  thyroid problems \u2013 both an overactive thyroid gland and an underactive thyroid gland can prevent ovulation premature ovarian failure \u2013 where a woman's ovaries stop working before the age of 40 ","Semen and sperm":"The most common cause of infertility in men is poor quality semen, the fluid containing sperm that's ejaculated during sex. Possible reasons for abnormal semen include: a lack of sperm \u2013 you may have a very low sperm count, or no sperm at all sperm that aren't moving properly \u2013 this will make it harder for sperm to swim to the egg abnormal sperm \u2013 sperm can sometimes be an abnormal shape, making it harder for them to move and fertilise an egg Many cases of abnormal semen are unexplained. There's a link between increased temperature of the scrotum and reduced semen quality, but it's uncertain whether wearing loose-fitting underwear improves fertility.  ","Sterilisation":"Some men choose to have a vasectomy if they don't want children or any more children.  It involves cutting and sealing off the tubes that carry sperm out of your testicles (the vas deferens) so your semen will no longer contain any sperm. A vasectomy can be reversed, but reversals aren't usually successful. ","Medicines and drugs":"Certain types of medicines can sometimes cause infertility problems. These medicines are listed below: sulfasalazine \u2013 an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis; sulfasalazine can decrease the number of sperm, but its effects are temporary and your sperm count should return to normal when you stop taking it anabolic steroids \u2013 are often used illegally to build muscle and improve athletic performance; long-term abuse of anabolic steroids can reduce sperm count and sperm mobility chemotherapy \u2013 medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes severely reduce sperm production herbal remedies \u2013 some herbal remedies, such as root extracts of the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii, can affect the production of sperm or reduce the size of your testicles Illegal drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, can also affect semen quality. In the UK, unexplained infertility accounts for around 25% of cases of infertility. This is where no cause can be identified in either the woman or man. If a cause for your fertility problems hasn't been identified, talk to your doctor about the next steps. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that women with unexplained infertility who haven't conceived after two years of having regular unprotected sex should be offered IVF treatment.

Regular unprotected sex means having sex every two to three days without using contraception. This page covers: When to get medical help Questions your doctor may ask Physical examination Fertility tests for women Fertility tests for men See your GP if you haven't conceived after one year of trying. You should see your GP sooner if you: are a woman aged 36 or over \u2013 the decline in fertility speeds up when a woman reaches her mid-30s have any reason to be concerned about your fertility \u2013 for example, if you've had treatment for cancer or you think you might have had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) Fertility tests can take time and female fertility decreases with age, so it's best to make an appointment early on. Your GP will be able to carry out an initial assessment to check things that may be causing your fertility problems and advise you about what to do next. It's always best for both partners to visit their GP as fertility problems can affect a man or a woman, or sometimes both. Trying to conceive can be an emotional process, so it's important to support each other as much as possible. Stress is just one factor that can affect fertility. Your GP will ask you about your medical and sexual history. ","Previous pregnancies and children":"If you're a woman, your GP will want to discuss any previous births and any complications with previous pregnancies. They'll also ask about any miscarriages you've had. If you're a man, you'll be asked whether you've had any children from previous relationships. ","Sex":"You'll be asked how often you have sex and whether you have any difficulties during sex. You may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed discussing your sex life with your GP, but it's best to be open and honest. If the fertility problem is to do with sex, it might be overcome easily. ","Blood tests":"A sample of your blood can be tested for a hormone called progesterone to check whether you're ovulating. The timing of the test is based on how regular your periods are. If you have irregular periods, you'll be offered a test to measure hormones called gonadotrophins, which stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. ","Laparoscopy":"Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) involves making a small cut in your lower tummy so a thin tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) can be inserted to examine your womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Dye may be injected into your fallopian tubes through your cervix to highlight any blockages in them. Laparoscopy is usually only used if it's likely that you have a problem \u2013 for example, if you've had an episode of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in the past, or if your scan suggests a possible blockage of one or both of your tubes. Tests to find out the cause of infertility in men include: ","Length of time trying to conceive":"Your GP will ask how long you've been trying to conceive. More than 80% of couples will conceive within one year if: the woman is under 40 years of age, and they don't use contraception and have regular sex (every two to three days) Of those who don't conceive in the first year, about half will do so in the second year. If you're young and healthy and you haven't been trying for a baby for very long, you may be advised to keep trying for a little longer. ","URL":"/conditions/Infertility","Length of time since stopping contraception":"You'll be asked about the type of contraception you previously used and when you stopped using it. It can sometimes take a while for certain types of contraception to stop working and this may be affecting your fertility. ","Ultrasound scan":"An ultrasound scan can be used to check your ovaries, womb and fallopian tubes. Certain conditions that can affect the womb, such as endometriosis and fibroids, can prevent pregnancy.  A scan can also be used to look for signs that your fallopian tubes \u2013 the tubes that connect the ovaries and the womb \u2013 may be blocked, which may be stopping eggs travelling along the tubes and into the womb.  If the ultrasound suggests a possible blockage, your doctor will refer you to a specialist to discuss further checks, such as a laparoscopy. During a transvaginal ultrasound scan, a small ultrasound probe is placed in your vagina. The scan can be used to check the health of your womb and ovaries and for any blockages in your fallopian tubes. A hysterosalpingo-contrast-ultrasonography is a special type of ultrasound scan sometimes used to check the fallopian tubes. A small amount of fluid is injected into your womb through a tube put into the neck of your womb (the cervix). Ultrasound is used to look at the fluid as it passes through the fallopian tubes to check for any blockages or abnormalities. Again, if the test suggests a possible blockage, your doctor will refer you to a specialist to discuss further checks, such as laparoscopy. ","Medical history and symptoms":"Your GP will want to discuss any medical conditions you have or have had in the past, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you're a woman, your GP may ask how regular your periods are and whether you experience any bleeding between periods or after sex. ","Medication":"Some medications can affect your fertility. Your GP will ask you about any medication you're taking, and might discuss alternative treatments with you. You should mention any non-prescription medication you're taking, including herbal medicines. ","Lifestyle":"Several lifestyle factors can affect your fertility. Your GP will want to know: if you smoke how much you weigh how much alcohol you drink whether you take any illegal drugs if you're stressed They may recommend making changes to your lifestyle to increase your chances of conceiving. Read more about: How can I increase my chances of becoming pregnant? How can I improve my chances of becoming a dad? After asking you questions, your GP may carry out a physical examination or refer you for tests. If you're a woman, your GP may: weigh you to see if you have a healthy body mass index (BMI) examine your pelvic area to check for infection, lumps or tenderness, which could be a sign of fibroids, ovarian tumours, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) \u2013 see causes of infertility If you're a man, your GP may check your: testicles to look for any lumps or deformities  penis to look at its shape and structure, and for any obvious abnormalities After a physical examination, you may be referred to a specialist infertility team at an NHS hospital or fertility clinic for further tests. Tests to find out the cause of infertility in women include: ","X-ray":"A hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of your womb and fallopian tubes after a special dye has been injected. It can be used to detect blockages in your fallopian tubes, which may be stopping eggs travelling along the tubes and into your womb.

"}},"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)":{"Treatment":{" ":"There's currently no cure for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and it isn't possible to stop cysts forming in the kidneys. However, there are some potentially useful medications, such as tolvaptan, that can sometimes be used to reduce the growth rate of cysts (see below). The various problems associated with ADPKD, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), pain and kidney stones, can also be treated. If you're diagnosed with ADPKD, you'll usually see a kidney specialist, who can help draw up a suitable treatment plan. The plan will also include what you would want to do if your kidneys stop working sufficiently (kidney failure). Some of the main treatments are described below. Medication is usually used to treat high blood pressure in people with ADPKD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) are the two medications most widely used. There are also some lifestyle changes you can make to help reduce your blood pressure, such as cutting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day (6g of salt is about one teaspoonful). Read more about treating high blood pressure. In many cases of ADPKD, any pain you experience can be relieved by treating the underlying cause, such as kidney stones or a urinary tract infection (UTI). If you need to take a painkiller, paracetamol is the best medication to try first. If your pain is particularly severe, you may be prescribed a stronger painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. It's usually recommended that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are avoided because they could disrupt kidney function and interfere with medications prescribed to control your blood pressure. However, a short course of NSAIDs may sometimes be safe for people with well controlled blood pressure and relatively normal kidney function. Antidepressants or anticonvulsants (which are normally used to treat epilepsy) may be prescribed for long-term (chronic) pain. These medications can also be used to relieve some types of pain. Occasionally, large cysts can be drained to help relieve the pain caused by the increased pressure. Small kidney stones pass out of your body when you urinate. If needed, you may be given a strong painkiller and medication to stop you feeling sick or vomiting. Drinking plenty of water will increase the flow of urine, which will help flush the stone into the bladder. If a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally, you may need treatment to help remove it. Possible treatment options include: using energy waves to break the stone into smaller pieces \u2013 this is known as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)  passing a thin telescopic instrument called a ureteroscope up your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) to remove or break up the stone Read more about treating kidney stones. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can often be treated with a seven to 14 day course of antibiotic tablets. You should drink plenty of fluids while you're waiting for the antibiotics to take effect because it will help relieve a high temperature. Paracetamol can be used to relieve pain. It's important to see your GP as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of a UTI, as it could spread to the cysts in your kidneys if left untreated. Infection in the cysts is harder to cure because it can be difficult for the antibiotics to penetrate them. If the infection persists despite antibiotic treatment, the infected cysts may need to be drained during surgery or using a needle inserted through your skin. If you have severe, persistent or frequently recurring UTIs, you may need surgery to remove one or both of your kidneys, followed by dialysis or a kidney transplant (see below). You'll have blood tests at varying intervals to monitor your kidney function. You should discuss with your doctors what treatment you'd like if your condition reaches a stage where your kidneys stop working altogether (kidney failure). The two main treatment options for kidney failure are: dialysis \u2013 where a machine replicates some of your kidneys' functions kidney transplant \u2013 where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure You only need one kidney to survive. Therefore, unlike other types of organ donation, a living person can donate a kidney. Close relatives usually make the best match, so you may want to see if a relative would consider being tested to find out whether they're a suitable donor. A few people with kidney failure decide not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, preferring simple treatment of their symptoms. For example, a person may choose this option if it's unlikely that dialysis will significantly prolong their life or improve their quality of life. If this choice is made, supportive treatment to help control symptoms will be provided to make the end of life as comfortable as possible. Tolvaptan is a medication that's recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to treat ADPKD in adults. It can be used to slow down the growth of cysts, reducing overall kidney growth and preserving kidney function for longer. However, tolvaptan can only be used in adults who have: chronic kidney disease (stage two or three) at the start of treatment evidence of rapidly progressing kidney disease Tolvaptan comes in tablet form and is taken twice a day as a split dose. Common side effects include: thirst passing more than three litres (just over five pints) of urine a day (polyuria) the need to urinate frequently \u2013 more than four or five times during the day and more than once at night (pollakiuria) the need to pass urine at night (nocturia) Chemical-related liver damage (hepatotoxicity) has also been reported in some people taking tolvaptan for ADPKD. If you're taking tolvaptan you'll need to initially be monitored frequently through hospital clinics. You can read more about the use of tolvaptan for treating ADPKD on the NICE website.   ","Avoiding injury":"If you have ADPKD, your kidneys will be more vulnerable to injury. For example, a sudden knock or blow to your kidneys could cause the cysts to split and bleed, leading to severe and intense pain. Therefore, avoiding all types of contact sport, such as rugby and football, is usually recommended. Page last reviewed: 11/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease"},"Introduction":{" ":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children affected by ADPKD are born with the condition, it rarely causes any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until a person is between 30 and 60 years of age. Less commonly, children or older people may have noticeable symptoms as a result of ADPKD. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including: abdominal (tummy) pain high blood pressure (hypertension)  blood in the urine (haematuria) \u2013 which may not always be noticeable to the naked eye potentially serious upper urinary tract infections (UTIs) kidney stones Kidney function will gradually deteriorate until so much is lost that kidney failure occurs. Read more about the symptoms of ADPKD and diagnosing ADPKD. ","":"ADPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts the normal development of some of the cells in the kidneys and causes cysts to grow. Faults in one of two different genes are known to cause ADPKD. The affected genes are: PKD1 \u2013 which accounts for 85% of cases PKD2 \u2013 which accounts for 15% of cases Both types of ADPKD have the same symptoms, but they tend to be more severe in PKD1. A child has a one in two (50%) chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rarer type of kidney disease which can only be inherited if both parents carry the faulty gene and in this type problems usually start much earlier, during childhood. ","Non-inherited ADPKD":"In around one in four (25%) cases, a person develops ADPKD without having a known family history of the condition. This could be because the condition was never diagnosed in a relative, or a relative with the condition may have died before their symptoms were recognised. In around one in 10 cases of ADPKD, the mutation develops for the first time in the affected person. It's not known what causes this to happen. The affected person can pass the faulty gene on to their children in the same way as someone who's inherited it from a parent (see above). ADPKD is the most common inherited condition to affect the kidneys, although it's still relatively uncommon. Only around one or two in every 1,000 people are born with ADPKD, which means there are currently around 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. There's currently no cure for ADPKD, but various treatments are available to manage problems caused by the condition. Most problems \u2013 such as high blood pressure, pain and UTIs \u2013 can be treated with medication, although you may need to have an operation to remove any large kidney stones that develop. If the condition reaches a point where the kidneys aren't able to function properly, there are two main treatment options: dialysis \u2013 where a machine is used to replicate kidney functions kidney transplant \u2013 where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure In some cases of ADPKD in adults (where chronic kidney disease is advanced and progressing rapidly), a medication called tolvaptan can be used to slow down the formation of cysts and protect kidney function. Read more about treating ADPKD. The outlook for ADPKD is highly variable. Some people experience kidney failure soon after the condition is diagnosed, whereas others may live the rest of their life with their kidneys working relatively well. On average, around half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by the time they're 60. As well as kidney failure, ADPKD can also cause a number of other potentially serious problems, such as heart attacks and strokes caused by high blood pressure, or bleeding on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) caused by a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain (brain aneurysm). Read more about the complications of ADPKD. If you have ADPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the back of the body, just underneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood and pass them out of the body in urine. The kidneys also play an important role in: helping to maintain blood pressure at a healthy level keeping salt and water in balance making hormones needed for the production of blood and bone Page last reviewed: 11/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease"},"Complications":{" ":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) can sometimes lead to potentially serious complications in other parts of the body besides the kidneys. Some of the main complications associated with ADPKD are described below. Many people with ADPKD develop cysts in other organs, as well as in their kidneys. The liver is also often affected by ADPKD. Cysts that develop in the liver don't usually disrupt normal liver function, but they can sometimes become infected and/or cause symptoms such as: abdominal (tummy) pain abdominal swelling and bloating in rare cases, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes from liver damage) In most cases, these symptoms will pass without the need for treatment. In rare cases, where a larger cyst causes severe or persistent pain, surgery may be required to drain the cyst. Very rarely, the liver can become so massively swollen that it stops working properly. In such cases it may be necessary to surgically remove some of the liver or carry out a complete liver transplant. As a result of high blood pressure, people with ADPKD also have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a general term that refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels and includes: coronary heart disease \u2013 where the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted stroke \u2013 when the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked, causing irreversible brain damage heart attack \u2013 when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked, causing irreversible damage to the heart muscle If you're at risk of developing CVD, you may be prescribed low-dose aspirin to help stop your blood clotting, and a medication called a statin to reduce your cholesterol levels. Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, reducing your alcohol intake, exercising regularly and eating a healthy, balanced diet, can also reduce your risk of developing CVD. Read more about preventing CVD. An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. As blood passes through the weakened part of the vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon. Brain aneurysms are more common in people with ADPKD than those in the general population, probably because the high blood pressure affects the weakened blood vessel walls. A brain aneurysm doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms unless it bursts (ruptures). A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding over the surface of the brain. This is known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage can include: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 often described as being like being suddenly hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision confusion stroke-like symptoms \u2013 such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent serious complications, brain damage and death. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think that you or someone you know is having a subarachnoid haemorrhage. ","Screening":"It's estimated that around 10% of people with ADPKD will develop a brain aneurysm, but most won't have any symptoms and it will never cause a problem. People with ADKPD who also have a family history of subarachnoid haemorrhages are at greater risk. If you have ADPKD and a family history of subarachnoid haemorrhages, you'll usually be offered a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scan to check for aneurysms in your brain. An MRA scan uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of your arteries and the blood flow within them. If no, or only small aneurysms are found, you'll be offered further scans at intervals of one to five years to check for new haemorrhages or an increase in the size of an existing one. If an aneurysm of a particular size is detected, and your doctor thinks there's a risk it could rupture in the future, they may recommend that you have an operation or procedure to prevent this.

When making a diagnosis, your GP will ask about your symptoms and your family's medical history. If your kidneys are enlarged, your GP may be able to feel them in your tummy (abdomen). Your GP may also arrange for some of the tests described below to be carried out. Your GP will measure your blood pressure to see whether it's higher than normal. They may also carry out other tests, such as: urine tests \u2013 to check for blood or protein in your urine blood tests \u2013 so that the rate your kidneys are filtering your blood can be estimated ","GFR blood test":"An effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a measure of how many millilitres (ml) of blood your kidneys are able to filter out waste products from in a minute. A healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml of blood per minute. Your GP will also arrange for you to have an ultrasound scan to look for cysts in your kidneys or other organs, such as your liver.  An ultrasound scan is a painless procedure where a small probe is passed across the skin over your kidneys. The probe emits high-frequency sound waves that are used to create an image of the inside of your body. In some cases, you may need to have a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These will show your kidneys in more detail. An MRI scan will be recommended if you have a family history of brain aneurysms. A brain aneurysm is a bulge in one of the blood vessels in the brain that's caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall.  Read more about diagnosing brain aneurysms. Screening people known to be at risk of developing ADPKD due to a family history of the condition is a controversial issue in the medical community. Some argue that screening achieves little because there's currently no treatment to stop ADPKD developing. Telling a person that they have ADPKD and are likely to develop kidney failure later in life could also cause them stress and anxiety. Others argue that although you can't prevent ADPKD, screening can help identify cysts, and it's possible to treat the high blood pressure (hypertension) associated with ADPKD, which may reduce the person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. If the diagnosis is known, complications won't come as a surprise and can be treated promptly and appropriately. There's also now a treatment called tolvaptan that can slow the growth of cysts and may be beneficial in some cases. If you're considering being screened for ADPKD, or having your children screened, you should discuss the advantages and disadvantages of screening with your GP, partner and family. You may also want to ask for a referral to see a kidney specialist. ","How screening is carried out":"Two methods can be used to confirm a diagnosis of ADPKD. They are: using an ultrasound, CT or MRI scan to check for kidney abnormalities in special circumstances, using genetic blood tests to determine whether you have inherited one of the genetic faults known to cause ADPKD in your family \u2013 however, as these genetic tests are expensive and can be difficult to interpret, they're not routinely carried out at present It's important to be aware that neither test is entirely accurate and may not always detect ADPKD, even if you have the condition. Imaging tests may miss very small cysts in younger people and will need to be repeated later in life. Genetic testing is more sensitive and accurate in diagnosing ADPKD but may be negative in 10% of people with ADPKD.

Although ADPKD is present from birth, it may not cause any obvious problems until the cysts have reached a size where they significantly affect how well your kidneys work. In most cases, this doesn't happen until 30 to 60 years of age. The growth of the cysts can eventually cause your kidneys to increase in size. In some cases, the kidneys of older adults with ADPKD can be three or four times larger than those of adults who don't have the condition. The growth of cysts in your kidneys can cause a wide range of problems, including: pain in your abdomen (tummy), side or lower back blood in your urine (haematuria) high blood pressure (hypertension) kidney stones recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) eventually, loss of kidney function \u2013 known as chronic kidney disease (CKD) These problems are described in more detail below. ","Blood in your urine":"Blood in your urine (haematuria) is another common initial symptom of ADPKD. Although it can often be a frightening symptom, it isn't usually a cause for concern and most cases will resolve within a week without the need for treatment. However, you should go to see your GP if you notice blood in your urine so that other possible causes, such as a growth in your bladder, can be investigated and excluded. ","Pain":"Pain in the abdomen, side or lower back is often the first noticeable symptom of ADPKD. This can be severe, but is usually short-lived \u2013 lasting from a few minutes to several days. Common causes of pain associated with ADPKD include: a cyst becoming larger bleeding into one or more cysts a kidney stone   a kidney or other part of your urinary system, such as your bladder, becoming infected (a UTI) ","High blood pressure":"Many experts consider high blood pressure to be the first effect of ADPKD but as it often doesn't cause any obvious symptoms, it's only usually detected during routine testing. Symptoms only occur when blood pressure reaches a very high level, which is rare. In such circumstances, symptoms can include: a persistent headache blurred or double vision nosebleeds  shortness of breath  See your GP immediately if you experience these symptoms so that the cause can be investigated. Untreated or poorly controlled high blood pressure is a major risk factor for a number of serious health conditions including heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. ","Urinary tract infections (UTIs)":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are broadly classified into one of two groups \u2013 lower UTIs and upper UTIs. A lower UTI is an infection that develops in your bladder or urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). An upper UTI is an infection that develops in your kidneys or ureters (the tubes that link your kidneys to your bladder). ADPKD doesn't increase your risk of developing lower UTIs such as bladder infections (cystitis), but it can mean that any lower UTIs you do develop could spread to your kidneys and become potentially serious upper UTIs. Symptoms of a lower UTI can include: cloudy urine a need to urinate more frequently, either during the day or night, or both pain or discomfort when passing urine an urgent need to urinate (holding urine in becomes more difficult) unpleasant smelling urine Symptoms of an upper UTI can include: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above uncontrollable shivering feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea  Visit your GP if you have ADPKD and you think you may have a UTI. You may need treatment to stop the infection spreading into the cysts in your kidneys. Most people with ADPKD will eventually lose a significant amount of kidney function. Loss of kidney function caused by kidney damage is known as chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD doesn't usually cause symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage, known as CKD stage 4 (when 75% of kidney function has been lost). The most advanced stage of CKD (stage 5) is called kidney failure or end-stage renal disease. This is when dialysis (removal of waste products and excess fluid from the blood) is essential to keep the person alive. Symptoms of kidney failure include: poor appetite and weight loss swollen ankles, feet or hands (oedema) shortness of breath an increased need to urinate, particularly at night itchy skin feeling sick in men, erectile dysfunction in women, absent periods (amenorrhoea) difficulty concentrating Kidney failure rarely happens suddenly, and treatment options should have been discussed and a treatment plan chosen before this stage is reached.

"}},"Abdominal pain":{"Title":"Stomach ache"},"Aphasia":{"Treatment":{"Treating aphasia ":"Sometimes aphasia will improve on its own without treatment, but a type of treatment called speech and language therapy is usually recommended. This treatment is carried out by a speech and language therapist (SLT). If you were admitted to hospital, there should be a speech and language therapy team there.  If you weren't admitted to hospital or didn't see an SLT while you were there, you can ask your GP to refer you. In some areas, you can contact your local speech and language therapy department directly. For people with aphasia, speech and language therapy aims to: help you communicate to the best of your ability  help restore as much of your speech and language as possible find alternative ways of communicating Evidence suggests speech and language therapy is more effective if it's started as soon as possible. For many people, the most obvious recovery happens in the first six months. However, improvements can continue to be seen for much longer after this, even many years later. How the therapy is carried out will depend on your circumstances. An intensive course of speech and language therapy may be recommended for some people. This involves a number of sessions spread out over a shorter period of time. However, speech and language therapy can be exhausting, and an intensive course of treatment will not be suitable for everyone. For some people, shorter and less intensive sessions may be recommended. Therapy may be individual sessions, groups, or using technology such as computer programmes or apps. The treatment you receive will depend on your general health and the difficulties you have with your speech, language or social skills, as there is no universally accepted treatment for aphasia. An assessment will be carried out before therapy begins so the therapist can identify which aspects of language you have the most difficulty with. A therapist will talk to you and your family to try to determine whether your problems are related to understanding language or if you have problems expressing yourself. The assessment will then focus on the areas that need to be targeted in therapy. Other health problems that may impact your ability to communicate, such as hearing or sight problems, will also be taken into account. The specific techniques used and the aims of the treatment will depend on each person's circumstances. Some examples are described below. If you have difficulty understanding words, your SLT may ask you to carry out tasks such as matching words to pictures or sorting words by their meaning. The aim of these tasks is to improve your ability to remember meanings and link them with other words. If you have difficulty expressing yourself, your SLT may ask you to practise naming pictures or judge whether certain words rhyme. They may also ask you to repeat words that they say, with prompting if necessary. If you are able to complete tasks with single words, your therapist will work on your ability to construct sentences. Some techniques may involve working with a computer. Other methods may include group therapy with other people with aphasia, or working with family members. This will allow you to practise conversational skills or rehearse common situations, such as making a telephone call. An increasing number of computer-based programmes and apps are available to help people with aphasia improve their language abilities. However, it's important to start using these alongside a speech and language therapist. An important part of speech therapy is finding different ways for you to communicate. Your therapist will help you develop alternatives to talking, such as using gesture, writing, drawing or communication charts. Communication charts are large grids containing letters, words or pictures. They allow someone with aphasia to communicate by pointing at the word or letter to indicate what they want to say. For some people, specially designed electronic devices, such as voice output communication aids (VOCAs), may be useful. VOCAs use a computer-generated voice to play messages aloud. This can help if you have difficulty speaking but are able to write or type. There are also apps available on smartphones and computer tablets that can do this. If a communication device is felt to be beneficial, funding for the purchase of an individual device can be discussed with a speech and language therapist. If you live with or care for a person with aphasia, you may be unsure about the best way to communicate with them. You may find the following advice helpful: After speaking, allow the person plenty of time to respond. If a person with aphasia feels rushed or pressured to speak, they may become anxious, which can affect their ability to communicate. Use short, uncomplicated sentences and do not change the topic of conversation too quickly. Avoid asking open-ended questions. Closed questions that have a yes or no answer can be better. Avoid finishing a person's sentences or correcting any errors in their language. This may cause resentment and frustration for the person with aphasia. Keep distractions to a minimum, such as background radio or TV noise. Use paper and a pen to write down key words or draw diagrams or pictures to help reinforce your message and support their understanding. If you do not understand something a person with aphasia is trying to communicate, do not pretend you understand. The person may find this patronising and upsetting. Use visual references, such as pointing, gesturing and using objects, to support their understanding. If they are having difficulty finding the right word, prompt them \u2013 ask them to describe the word, think of a similar word, try to visualise it, think of the sound the word starts with, try to write the word, use gestures, or point to an object. Research is currently being carried out to study whether other treatments can benefit people with aphasia. These include: medication \u2013 such as piracetam, bifemelane, piribedil, bromocriptine and idebenone transcranial magnetic stimulation \u2013 where an electromagnet placed on the scalp is stimulated for a short time using an electric current to stimulate parts of the brain affected by aphasia Although some studies have suggested these treatments may benefit some people with aphasia, further research is necessary. You can search the database of clinical trials for aphasia to find trials that are studying these treatments. Helping to care for a loved one, relative or friend with aphasia can be a daunting and challenging prospect, particularly during the first few months after the onset of symptoms. People with aphasia often have complex needs, and their condition can make them prone to mood swings and challenging behaviour. If you're caring for someone with aphasia, you may find the Care and support section of this website useful, particularly the section on communication problems. Speakability, Connect and the Stroke Association are the main UK charities that provide help and support for people affected by aphasia.

People with aphasia make mistakes with the words they use, sometimes using the wrong sounds in a word, choosing the wrong word, or putting words together incorrectly. Aphasia also affects speaking and writing in the same way. Many people with the condition find it difficult to understand words and sentences they hear or read. Aphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and using language. Common causes include: stroke \u2013 thought to be the most common cause, around one in three people experience some degree of aphasia after having a stroke severe head injury brain tumour progressive neurological conditions \u2013 conditions that, over time, cause progressive brain and nervous system damage Read more about the causes of aphasia. Aphasia is often classified as \"expressive\" or \"receptive\" aphasia, depending on whether there are difficulties with understanding or expressing language, or both. Symptoms can range from getting a few words mixed up to having difficulty with all forms of communication, such as reading, writing, naming objects and understanding speech. Some people are unaware their speech makes no sense and get frustrated when others don't understand them. Read more about the symptoms of aphasia. A speech and language therapist (SLT) usually diagnoses the condition by testing your language capabilities. They can also help arrange treatment. Speech and language therapy is the main type of treatment for people with aphasia. This aims to help restore some of your ability to communicate, as well as help you develop alternative ways of communicating, if necessary. You may receive speech and language therapy on an individual basis or in a group, depending on your needs and the service provided. An increasing number of computer-based applications are available to support people with aphasia. However, it's important to start using these with the assistance of a speech and language therapist. How successful treatment is differs from person to person, but most people with aphasia make some degree of recovery, and some recover fully. Even if aphasia persists, it does not mean a person is unable to live an independent and meaningful life. However, the chances of recovery for people with aphasia related to progressive neurological conditions is poor. This is because there is no way of repairing or preventing the ongoing injury to the brain. When aphasia is caused by a progressive condition, treatment focuses on making the most of what people can still do and developing other ways of communicating to prepare for a time when speaking will be more difficult. Read more about diagnosing aphasia and treating aphasia. The challenges of living with aphasia can impact how a person feels and interacts with others. In some cases, it can lead to: isolation anxiety depression If you're concerned about someone with aphasia, encourage them to discuss any problems with their GP or a member of their care team to access the relevant support. If the person is unable to do this themselves, they may require someone to communicate on their behalf. Aphasia is one of the most common communication disorders to affect the brain. Although there are no official figures, the Stroke Association estimates more than 376,000 stroke survivors in the UK are living with aphasia. Aphasia can affect people of all ages, including children. It's most common in people over the age of 65, as stroke and common progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults. If you have aphasia, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Any damage to the language areas of the brain can result in loss of function, leading to aphasia. The severity of a person's aphasia depends on the location and type of injury sustained by the brain. Aphasia can occur by itself or alongside other disorders, such as visual difficulties, mobility problems, limb weakness and cognitive changes. Aphasia affects a person's language, but it doesn't affect a person's intelligence. Ways the brain can become damaged include: stroke \u2013 the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen during a stroke, which leads to death of brain tissue severe head injury \u2013 for example, an injury as a result of a road traffic accident or after a serious fall from height brain tumour \u2013 where an abnormal growth of cells develops inside the brain health conditions that cause progressive loss of brain cells, such as dementia \u2013 Parkinson's disease does not cause aphasia, but some very similar conditions may do so, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD) infections that affect the brain \u2013 such as meningitis (an infection of the outer layer of the brain) and encephalitis (an infection of the brain itself), although this is a much rarer cause of aphasia ","Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.":"This animation explains how a stroke happens, the different types of stroke and how lifestyle changes may help to reduce the risks.

There are several tests used to assess communication skills. These tests often involve simple exercises, such as asking a person to name as many words as they can think of beginning with the letter F, or asking them to name objects in the room. The results can then be used to build up a detailed picture of a person's capabilities in areas such as: understanding basic speech and grammar expressing words, phrases and sentences social communication \u2013 for example, holding a conversation or understanding a joke reading and writing letters, words and sentences Imaging techniques can be used to assess the extent of any brain damage. The two most widely used types for aphasia are: computerised tomography (CT) scan magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Less commonly, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be used to assess the state and functionality of the brain. PET scans are usually only used to carry out clinical research at specialist centres.

In cases where aphasia has been caused by a sudden brain injury, such as a stroke or a severe head injury, symptoms will usually develop straight after the injury. In cases where there is gradual damage to the brain as a result of a condition that gets worse over time, such as dementia or a brain tumour, the symptoms may develop gradually. Someone with expressive aphasia experiences difficulty communicating their thoughts, ideas and messages to others. This may affect speech, writing, gestures or drawing, and causes problems with everyday tasks such as using the telephone, writing an email, or speaking to family and friends. People with expressive aphasia may have some of the following signs and symptoms: slow and halting speech they may struggle to get certain words out, such as the names of objects, places or people the content of their speech is stripped down to simple elements and only contains basic nouns and verbs \u2013 for example, \"want drink\" or \"go town today\" spelling or grammatical errors using the wrong word, such as saying \"chair\" instead of \"table\" difficulty constructing a sentence being able to write or speak fluently, using long sentences, but often including nonsense words or their speech lacks meaning A person with receptive aphasia experiences difficulty understanding things they hear or read. They may also have difficulty interpreting gestures, drawings, numbers and pictures. This can affect everyday activities such as reading an email, managing finances, having conversations, listening to the radio, or following TV programmes. People with receptive aphasia may have some of the following signs and symptoms: difficulty understanding what people say difficulty understanding written words misinterpreting the meaning of words, gestures, pictures or drawings giving responses that may not make sense if they've misunderstood questions or comments not being aware of their difficulties with understanding This type of aphasia occurs in people with a specific type of dementia. As it's a primary progressive condition, the symptoms get worse over time. Usually, the first problem people with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) notice is difficulty finding the right word or remembering somebody's name. The problems gradually get worse and can include: speech becoming hesitant and difficult, and making mistakes with the sounds of words or grammar speech becomes slow with short, simple sentences forgetting the meaning of complicated words, and later also simple ones, making it more difficult for them to understand other people speech becomes more vague, and the person has difficulty being specific or clarifying what they're saying becoming less and less likely to join in with or start conversations A person with PPA may also experience other symptoms later in their illness, including changes in their personality and behaviour, difficulties with memory and thinking similar to Alzheimer's disease, or difficulties with movement similar to Parkinson's disease.

Fortunately, serious problems are uncommon. The risk of experiencing complications is generally higher for older people and those in generally poor health. Possible problems include: Infection \u2013 there's a risk of wound infections, lung infections, bladder infections and heart valve infections (endocarditis). You may be given antibiotics to reduce this risk. Excessive bleeding \u2013 tubes may be inserted into your chest to drain the blood, and sometimes another operation is needed to stop the bleeding. Blood clots \u2013 this is more likely if you have had mechanical valve replacement. You'll be prescribed anticoagulant medication if you're at risk. Stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u2013 where the supply of blood to the brain becomes blocked. The valve may wear out \u2013 this is more likely in people who have had a biological valve replacement for a long time. Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) \u2013 this affects around 25% of people after an aortic valve replacement and usually passes with time. However, 1-2% of people will need to have a pacemaker fitted to control their heartbeat. Kidney problems \u2013 in up to 5% of people, the kidneys do not work as well as they should for the first few days after surgery. In a few cases, temporary dialysis may be needed. An aortic valve replacement is a major operation and occasionally the complications can be fatal. Overall, the risk of dying as a result of the procedure is estimated to be 1-3%.

The aortic valve controls the flow of blood out from the heart to the rest of the body. An aortic valve replacement involves removing a faulty or damaged valve and replacing it with a new one made from synthetic materials or animal tissue. It's a major operation that isn't suitable for everyone and can take a long time to recover from. ","When is it necessary to replace the aortic valve?":"The aortic valve may need to be replaced for two reasons: the valve has become narrowed (aortic stenosis) \u2013 the opening of the valve becomes smaller, obstructing the flow of blood out of the heart the valve is leaky (aortic regurgitation) \u2013 the valve allows blood to flow back through into the heart The problems can get worse over time and in severe cases can lead to life-threatening problems such as heart failure, if left untreated. There are no medicines to treat aortic valve problems, so replacing the valve will be recommended if you're at risk of serious complications, but are otherwise well enough to have surgery.  Read more about why aortic valve replacements are carried out. ","How is an aortic valve replacement carried out?":"An aortic valve replacement is carried out under general anaesthetic. This means you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain while it's carried out. During the procedure: a large cut (incision) about 25cm long is made in your chest to access your heart \u2013 although sometimes a smaller cut may be made your heart is stopped and a heart-lung (bypass) machine is used to take over the job of your heart during the operation the damaged or faulty valve is removed and replaced with the new one your heart is restarted and the opening in your chest is closed The operation usually takes a few hours. You'll have a discussion with your doctor or surgeon before the procedure to decide whether a synthetic or animal tissue replacement valve is most suitable for you. Read more about what happens during an aortic valve replacement. ","Recovering from an aortic valve replacement":"You'll usually need to stay in hospital for about a week after an aortic valve replacement, although it may be two to three months before you fully recover. You should take things easy when you first get home, but you can start to gradually return to your normal activities over the next few weeks. You'll be given specific advice about any side effects you can expect while you recover and any activities you should avoid. You won't usually be able to drive for around four to six weeks and you'll probably need six to 12 weeks off work, depending on your job. Read more about recovering from an aortic valve replacement. ","Alternatives to an aortic valve replacement":"An aortic valve replacement is the most effective treatment for aortic valve conditions. Alternative procedures are usually only used if open heart surgery is too risky. Possible alternatives include: transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) \u2013 the replacement valve is guided into place through the blood vessels, rather than through a large incision in the chest aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty \u2013 the valve is widened using a balloon sutureless aortic valve replacement \u2013 the valve is not secured using stitches (sutures), to minimise the time spent on a heart-lung machine Read more about the alternatives to an aortic valve replacement.

"},"What happens":{"The operation":"An aortic valve replacement is carried out under general anaesthetic. This means you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain while it's carried out. The operation usually lasts a few hours. During the procedure: a large cut (incision) around 25cm long will be made along the middle of your breastbone to allow the surgeon access to your heart, although in some cases a smaller cut may be made tubes are inserted into your heart and major blood vessels, which are attached to a heart-lung (bypass) machine \u2013 this will take over the job of your heart during the operation medication is used to stop your heart and your main artery (aorta) is clamped shut \u2013 this allows your surgeon to open your heart and operate on it without blood pumping through the aorta is opened up and the damaged aortic valve is removed the new valve is sewn in place with a fine thread your heart is started again using controlled electric shocks, before you're taken off the bypass machine your breastbone is joined up with wires, and the wound on your chest closed using dissolvable stitches ","What happens before and during an aortic valve replacement ":"An aortic valve replacement is a major operation and will only be carried out if you're well enough to have surgery. ","Choice of valve replacement":"Before having an aortic valve replacement, you'll need to decide on the most suitable type of replacement valve for you. There are two main types of replacement valve: mechanical valves \u2013 made of synthetic materials biological valves \u2013 made of animal tissue Each type has advantages and disadvantages, which your doctor will discuss with you. The main advantage of mechanical valves is that they're hard-wearing and less likely to need replacing. This means they're often better for younger people having a valve replacement. However, there's a tendency for potentially dangerous blood clots to form on the valve, so lifelong treatment with anticoagulant medication such as warfarin is needed to prevent this. This will increase the chances of excessive bleeding from a cut or injury, particularly as you get older, and may not be suitable if you've had significant bleeding problems in the past. Mechanical valves can also make a quiet clicking noise, which can be disturbing at first, but is easy to get used to. The main advantage of biological valves is that there's less risk of clots forming, so lifelong anticoagulant treatment isn't usually necessary. However, biological valves tend to wear out a bit faster than mechanical valves and may eventually need to be replaced after many years. Therefore, they are often better for older people having a valve replacement.

This is also a good time to ask any questions you have about the procedure. As part of this assessment, you may: have a physical examination be asked about your medical history, including any medication you're taking, any allergies you have and whether you've had a reaction to anaesthesia in the past have tests to check your general and heart health \u2013 these may include a blood test, X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or echocardiogram If you smoke, you'll be advised to stop in the lead up to your operation because this can reduce the risk of complications. You should be told when you need to stop eating and drinking before the procedure. When you have the operation, it's likely you'll be in hospital for about a week, so you'll need to make some practical preparations in advance. These include bringing clothes, toiletries and any equipment you use, such as a walking stick or hearing aid. Read more about going into hospital and preparing for surgery. "},"Why it's done":{"Causes of aortic valve disease":"Some of the main causes include: senile aortic calcification \u2013 where calcium deposits form on the valve as you get older, preventing it from opening and closing properly bicuspid aortic valve \u2013 a problem present from birth, in which the aortic valve only has two flaps instead of the usual three, which can cause problems as you get older underlying conditions that can damage the aortic valve \u2013 including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, rheumatic fever, lupus, giant cell arteritis and endocarditis ","Why you might need an aortic valve replacement ":"An aortic valve replacement is used to treat conditions affecting the aortic valve. These are known as aortic valve diseases. The two main aortic valve diseases are: aortic stenosis \u2013 where the valve is narrowed, restricting blood flow aortic regurgitation \u2013 where the valve allows blood to leak back into the heart These problems can be something you're born with, or can develop later in life. ","Problems caused by aortic valve disease":"If you have aortic valve disease, you may not experience any symptoms at first. However, the condition can eventually become more severe and cause: chest pain brought on by physical activity (angina) \u2013 caused by your heart having to work harder shortness of breath \u2013 at first you may only notice this when you exercise, but later you may experience this even when resting dizziness or light-headedness \u2013 caused by the obstruction of blood flow from your heart loss of consciousness (fainting) \u2013 also a result of reduced blood flow In particularly serious cases, aortic valve disease can lead to life-threatening problems such as heart failure. ","When surgery is recommended":"If you have an aortic valve disease and you have no or only mild symptoms, you'll probably just be monitored to check whether the condition is getting worse.

Starting gentle exercise such as walking can be helpful when you feel up to it, but don't try to do too much too quickly. Your doctor or surgeon can give you specific advice about when you can return to your normal activities, but generally speaking: you can be a passenger in a car straight away you may not be able to drive for around six weeks \u2013 wait until you can comfortably do an emergency stop you can have sex after four to six weeks \u2013 make sure you feel strong enough first when you can return to work depends on the type of work you do \u2013 this could be as soon as six to eight weeks if your job mainly involves light work, but may not be for three months if it involves manual labour you should avoid strenuous exercise, sudden strains and heavy lifting for three months While at home, you may experience some temporary side effects that should start to improve as you recover.

Page last reviewed: 12/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 "},"Alternatives":{"Sutureless aortic valve replacement":"Sutureless aortic valve replacement is the newest alternative to traditional open surgery. The main difference between the two procedures is that there are no stitches (sutures) used to secure the replacement valve in place. The aim of this procedure is to minimise the amount of time the operation takes, so there is less time spent on a bypass machine. It may be an option for people who have a high risk of complications during the standard procedure. As the procedure is relatively new, the long-term effects are not yet fully known. However, it's thought that the main risks of this treatment are blood leaking around the replacement valve or a blood clot forming. A leak may mean the procedure has to be repeated to fix the problem, or an alternative treatment may be used. If a blood clot forms, the person could have a stroke. Page last reviewed: 12/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","Aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty":"Aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty involves passing a catheter (a thin plastic tube) through a large blood vessel, into the heart. A balloon is then inflated to open up the aortic valve. This can help treat a narrowed aortic valve (aortic stenosis), but doesn't help with a leaky aortic valve (aortic regurgitation). Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty should only be used in people who are not suitable for conventional open surgery. It can also be used as a short-term treatment for babies and children, until they're old enough for valve replacement. The main drawback with this type of treatment is that the effects may only last for up to a year. After this, further treatment is needed. ","Alternatives to aortic valve replacement ":"Aortic valve replacement is the most effective treatment for aortic valve diseases. However, it can place tremendous strain on the body and alternatives procedures may be needed. The main procedures that may be recommended for people who aren't in good enough overall health to have a conventional aortic valve replacement are outlined below. ","Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel in your upper leg or chest and passing it towards your aortic valve. The catheter is then used to guide and fix a replacement valve over the top of the old one. The main advantages of this technique are that the heart doesn't need to be stopped, so a heart-lung (bypass) machine doesn't need to be used, and it avoids making a large cut (incision) in your chest. This puts less strain on the body and may mean TAVI is more suitable for people who are too frail to have a conventional valve replacement. Research suggests the procedure may be as effective as surgery for people in whom surgery would be difficult or risky, and it may result in a faster recovery. But there's little evidence to suggest it's appropriate for people who are suitable for surgery and at a low risk of complications. Possible complications of TAVI are similar to those of a conventional valve replacement, although the risk of having a stroke after TAVI is higher.

Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is usually carried out in three stages. They are: induction \u2013 the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood and resolve any symptoms you may have consolidation \u2013 this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system maintenance \u2013 the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning ","Dasatinib":"Dasatinib is a new type of medication used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, when all other treatments have proved unsuccessful. Dasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Dasatinib can't cure acute leukaemia but it can slow its growth, helping to relieve symptoms and prolong life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) hasn't decided whether the NHS should provide treatment with dasatinib for people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This means it will be at the discretion of your local clinical commissioning group (CCG) as to whether you'll be offered dasatinib. ","Stem cell and bone marrow transplants":"A stem cell and bone marrow transplant is a possible alternative treatment option if you or your child don't respond to chemotherapy. Transplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister. Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body. This can put a big strain on the body so transplantations are usually only successful when they're carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and when there's a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister. Recent research has shown that it's possible for people over the age of 40 to have a reduced intensity stem cell transplant. This is where lower than normal doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used before the transplant, which places less strain on the body. In the UK, clinical trials are currently being carried out to find the best way of treating acute leukaemia. These studies are using new, innovative techniques to see how well they work in treating and possibly curing acute leukaemia. It's important to be aware of new studies so that you can choose which treatments to have. However, there's no guarantee the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will be more effective than current treatments. Your care team will be able to tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved. Page last reviewed: 04/10/2016 Next review due: 04/10/2019 ","Induction":"The induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or a specialist centre. This is because you'll probably need regular blood transfusions as your blood won't contain enough healthy blood cells. You'll also be vulnerable to infection, so it's important you're in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that develops can be treated quickly. Antibiotics may also be prescribed to help prevent further infection. You'll have chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. Although some medications may be given as pills, you'll need more than one medication given as an injection. To make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given through a flexible tube (a 'central line') that goes into a vein in your chest. Some chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system and brain. The type of chemotherapy medication used is called methotrexate and it's given as an injection into your spine, in a similar way to a lumbar puncture. After you've had the injection, you'll have to lie flat for a few hours with your head positioned slightly lower than your feet. You may have a headache or feel sick afterwards. Methotrexate is also given intravenously (directly into a vein) in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia after induction therapy and before consolidation. Other common side effects following chemotherapy include: nausea vomiting diarrhoea  loss of appetite mouth ulcers  tiredness skin rashes infertility hair loss  The side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Your hair will usually take between three to six months to grow back. You may also be given corticosteroid injections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. If you have a type of leukaemia known as Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you'll also be given a medicine called imatinib. Imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. This kills the cancerous cells. Imatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. They include: nausea vomiting swelling in the face and lower legs muscle cramps rash diarrhoea Depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from two weeks to several months. In some cases, you or your child may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve. Leukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. Therefore, the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed. Treatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. This is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or you develop an infection. The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months. The maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. It involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while having regular check-ups to monitor the effectiveness of your treatment. The maintenance phase can often last for two years. As well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. These are described below.  ","Radiotherapy":"Radiotherapy is where high doses of controlled radiation are used to kill cancerous cells. It's usually used to treat acute leukaemia in the following two situations:  to treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain to prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below) Side effects include: hair loss nausea fatigue These side effects should pass after your course of radiotherapy has been completed. However, your skin may be very sensitive to the effects of light for several months after treatment has finished. If this is the case, avoid sunbathing or exposure to sources of artificial light, such as sunbeds, for several months. Many younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty. A small number of people develop cataracts several years after having radiotherapy. Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. Cataracts can usually be successfully treated using cataract surgery. ","URL":"/conditions/leukaemia-acute-lymphoblastic"},"Introduction":{" ":"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. It progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment. Both adults and children can be affected. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is very rare, with around 650 people diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Half of all cases diagnosed are in adults and half in children. Although rare, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of childhood leukaemia. About 85% of the cases that affect children occur in those younger than 15 (mostly between the ages of two and five). It tends to be more common in males than females. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is different to other types of leukaemia, including acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia. This page covers: What happens in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatment Complications Outlook All of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow, a spongy material found inside bones. Bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells, which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells: red blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection platelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding Normally, bone marrow doesn't release stem cells into the blood until they are fully developed blood cells. But in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, large numbers of white blood cells are released before they are ready. These are known as blast cells. As the number of blast cells increases, the number of red blood cells and platelet cells decreases. This causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, breathlessness and an increased risk of excessive bleeding. Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually starts slowly before rapidly becoming severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. Most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply. Symptoms include: pale skin feeling tired and breathless repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above night sweats bone and joint pain easily bruised skin swollen lymph nodes (glands) abdominal pain \u2013 caused by a swollen liver or spleen unexplained weight loss  a purple skin rash (purpura) In some cases, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including: headaches  seizures (fits) vomiting blurred vision dizziness If you or your child has some or even all of the symptoms listed above, it's still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause. However, see your GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs prompt investigation and treatment. Read more about diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It is a genetic change (mutation) in the stem cells that causes immature white blood cells to be released into the bloodstream. It's not clear what causes the DNA mutation to occur, but known risk factors include: previous chemotherapy \u2013 if you've had chemotherapy to treat unrelated cancers in the past, your risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is increased; the risk relates to certain types of chemotherapy medicine (etoposide, mitoxantrone, amsacrine and idarubicin), and how much treatment you had smoking \u2013 smokers are much more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers, and studies have shown that parents who smoke in the home may increase the risk of leukaemia in their children being very overweight (obese) \u2013 some studies have shown that people who are very overweight have a slightly higher risk of developing leukaemia than those who are a normal weight genetic disorders \u2013 a small number of cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are thought to be related to genetic disorders, including Down's syndrome having a weakened immune system \u2013 people with lowered immunity (as a result of having HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants) have an increased risk of developing leukaemia  Cancer Research UK has more information about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia risks and causes. As acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, treatment usually begins a few days after diagnosis. Treatment is usually carried out in the following stages:  induction \u2013 initially, treatment aims to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood and resolve any symptoms you may have consolidation \u2013 aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system maintenance \u2013 involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning Chemotherapy is the main treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Other treatments you may need include antibiotics and blood transfusions. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant may also be needed to achieve a cure. Read more about treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. If a cure for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia isn't possible, there's a risk that the lack of healthy blood cells can make the person: extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections (because of the lack of white blood cells) prone to uncontrolled and serious bleeding (because of the lack of platelets) These two complications, plus a number of others, are discussed further in complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The outlook for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is usually good. Almost all children will achieve remission (a period of time where they're free from symptoms), and 85% will be completely cured. The outlook for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less promising. Around 40% of people aged between 25 and 64 will live for five years or more after receiving their diagnosis. In those aged 65 or over, around 15% will live for five years or more after being diagnosed. Cancer Research UK has more detailed survival statistics for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Extensive research has been carried out to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia: living near a nuclear power station living near a power line living near a building or facility that releases electro-magnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mast There's currently no firm evidence to suggest that any of these environmental factors increases the risk of developing leukaemia. Page last reviewed: 04/10/2016 Next review due: 04/10/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/leukaemia-acute-lymphoblastic"},"Complications":{" ":"Being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some people with acute leukaemia. There are two reasons for this: the lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat acute leukaemia can weaken the immune system This makes you more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you do have is more likely to cause serious complications. You may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring. You should report any possible symptoms of an infection immediately to your GP or care team because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications. Symptoms of infection include: high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above headache  aching muscles diarrhoea  tiredness Avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection, even if it's a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower. It's important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your wellbeing, but you should avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour. Also, make sure all of your vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You'll be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses or bacteria such as the: mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine  polio vaccine  oral typhoid vaccine  BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) yellow fever vaccine  If you have acute leukaemia, you'll bleed and bruise more easily because of the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Although major bleeding is uncommon, you need to be aware of the related symptoms that can occur in different parts of the body. Bleeding can occur: inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) The symptoms of an intracranial haemorrhage include: severe headache stiff neck vomiting change in mental state, such as confusion The most common symptoms of a pulmonary haemorrhage are: coughing up blood from your nose and mouth breathing difficulties a bluish skin tone (cyanosis) The two most common symptoms of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage are: vomiting blood passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like All three types of haemorrhages should be regarded as medical emergencies. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you suspect that you or your child is experiencing a haemorrhage. Many of the treatments used to treat acute leukaemia can cause infertility. Infertility is often temporary, although in some cases it may be permanent. People who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who've received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for stem cell and bone marrow transplants. It may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can store sperm samples. Similarly, women can have fertilised embryos stored, which can be put back into their womb following treatment. Being diagnosed with leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if a cure is unlikely. At first, the news may be difficult to take in. It can be particularly difficult if you don't currently have any leukaemia symptoms, but you know that it could present a serious problem later on. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be very stressful and can trigger feelings of anxiety and depression. If you've been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better. You may find it useful to talk to other people living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups. Macmillan Cancer Support is also an excellent resource. Its helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and is open Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm.   You can read more about all aspects of living and coping with cancer at the following links: living with cancer \u2013 including information about treatment, support and personal experiences of cancer living with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia \u2013 Cancer Research UK Page last reviewed: 04/10/2016 Next review due: 04/10/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/leukaemia-acute-lymphoblastic"},"Title":"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","Diagnosis":{" ":"The first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample. If the blood sample contains a high number of abnormal white blood cells, it could be a sign of acute leukaemia. Your GP will refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions). To confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. The haematologist will use a local anaesthetic to numb the skin over a bone \u2013 usually the hip bone \u2013 before removing a sample of bone marrow with a needle. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes and you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. The bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and, if found, the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time. Some people with acute leukaemia will need to have a bone marrow assessment to check for cancerous cells every three months for at least two years during maintenance treatment or after having a bone marrow transplant. A number of additional tests (described below) can be used to find out about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. They can also help guide treatment. ","Lymph node biopsy":"If you've been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. These will establish how far the leukaemia has spread. ","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)":"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be carried out on a blood sample. PCR can help diagnose and monitor the response to treatment. The blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved. ","Chest X-ray":"You may have an X-ray so that the chest can be examined for any swollen lymph nodes. ","Immunophenotyping":"Immunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied. This testing is important as the treatment needed may be slightly different for each type. ","Cytogenetic testing":"Cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. Specific genetic variations can occur during leukaemia, and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment. ","URL":"/conditions/leukaemia-acute-lymphoblastic","Lumbar puncture":"A lumbar puncture may be carried out if there's a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system. A needle is inserted into the lower part of your spine to extract a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds and protects your spine), which is tested for cancer cells. Page last reviewed: 04/10/2016 Next review due: 04/10/2019 ","CT scans":"If you have acute leukaemia, a computerised tomography (CT) scan may be used to assess how far the leukaemia has spread and to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy. "}},"Osteoarthritis":{"Treatment":{" ":"There's no cure for osteoarthritis, but the condition doesn\u2019t necessarily get any worse over time and a number of treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. The main treatments for osteoarthritis include: lifestyle measures \u2013 such as maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly medication \u2013 to relieve your pain supportive therapies \u2013 to help make everyday activities easier. In a few cases, where other treatments haven't been helpful, surgery to repair, strengthen or replace damaged joints may also be considered. ","Lifestyle changes hide":"Exercise is one of the most important treatments for people with osteoarthritis, whatever your age or level of fitness. Your physical activity should include a combination of exercises to strengthen your muscles and exercises to improve your general fitness. If osteoarthritis causes you pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. However, regular exercise that keeps you active, builds up muscle and strengthens the joints usually helps to improve symptoms. Exercise is also good for losing weight, improving your posture and relieving stress, all of which will ease symptoms. Your GP, or possibly a physiotherapist, will discuss the benefits you can expect from your exercise programme and can give you an exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan because there's a risk that doing too much exercise too quickly, or doing the wrong sort of exercise, may damage your joints. Read more about health and fitness including simple ways to exercise at home. Being overweight or obese often makes osteoarthritis worse as it can place some of your joints under increased strain. To find out if you are overweight or obese, use the healthy weight calculator. If you're overweight, try to lose weight by doing more physical activity and eating a healthier diet. Discuss any new exercise plan with your GP or physiotherapist before you start. They can help plan a suitable exercise programme for you. Your GP and practice nurse can also advise about how to lose weight slowly and safely. Read more information and tips on losing weight. Want to know more? Arthritis Care: exercise and arthritis Arthritis Care: diet and arthritis ","Capsaicin cream":"Your GP may prescribe capsaicin cream if you have osteoarthritis in your hands or knees and topical NSAIDs haven't been effective in easing your pain. Capsaicin cream works by blocking the nerves that send pain messages in the treated area. You may have to use it for a while before it has an effect. You should experience some pain relief within the first two weeks of using the cream, but it may take up to a month for the treatment to be fully effective. Apply a pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream to your affected joints up to four times a day, but not more often than every four hours. Don't use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it. Be careful not to get any capsaicin cream on delicate areas, such as your eyes, mouth, nose and genitals. Capsaicin is made from chillies, so if you get it on sensitive areas of your body, it's likely to be very painful for a few hours. However, it won't cause any damage. You may notice a burning sensation on your skin after applying capsaicin cream. This is nothing to worry about, and the more you use it, the less it should happen. But avoid using too much cream or having a hot bath or shower before or after applying it, because it can make the burning sensation worse. If your osteoarthritis is severe, treatment using painkillers may not be enough to control your pain. In this case, you may be able to have a type of treatment where medicine is injected into the joints affected by osteoarthritis. This is known as intra-articular injection. If you need intra-articular injections, it's likely that you'll have injections of corticosteroid, a medicine that reduces swelling and pain. If you get a prolonged response to the injection, it may be repeated. Ideally, you should have no more than three corticosteroid injections a year, with at least a three-month gap between injections. Viscosupplementation may be available as a treatment option for people who have tried all other non-surgical treatments without success. It involves receiving up to five injections of hyaluronic acid directly into the affected joints over several weeks. Hyaluronic acid is found in the synovial fluid in joints and acts as both a lubricant and shock absorber. If the injections are successful, the procedure may be repeated around every six months. There's evidence that viscosupplementation may help to temporarily reduce pain and improve symptoms of osteoarthritis in some people. However, many people may not benefit from the injections and more research is needed about the long-term effects. Want to know more? Arthritis Care: taking medication Arthritis Research UK: arthritis drugs ","Paracetamol":"If you have pain caused by osteoarthritis, your GP may suggest taking paracetamol to begin with. This is available over the counter in pharmacies without a prescription. It's best to take it regularly rather than waiting until your pain becomes unbearable. However, when taking paracetamol, always follow the dosage your GP recommends and don't exceed the maximum dose stated on the pack. ","Complementary and alternative therapies show":"Some people with osteoarthritis try complementary or alternative therapies \u2013 such as acupuncture and aromatherapy \u2013 and find them helpful. However, there's often a lack of medical evidence to suggest they're effective and they generally aren't recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). A number of nutritional supplements have also been used to treat osteoarthritis in the past, including chondroitin and glucosamine. Glucosamine hydrochloride hasn't been shown to have any beneficial effects, but there's evidence that glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin sulphate may help symptoms to a small degree and don't cause many side effects. However, these supplements can be expensive and NICE recommends that they shouldn't routinely be offered on the NHS.  Rubefacients are available as gels and creams that produce a warm, reddening effect on your skin when you rub them in. Several rubefacients have been used to treat joint pain caused by osteoarthritis. However, research has shown that rubefacients have little effect in improving the symptoms of osteoarthritis and NICE therefore doesn't recommend their use. Want to know more? Arthritis Research UK: complementary therapies ","Medication show":"Your doctor will talk to you about medicines that can control symptoms of osteoarthritis, including painkillers. Sometimes a combination of therapies \u2013 medicines, exercise and assistive devices or surgery \u2013 may be needed to help control your pain. The type of painkiller (analgesic) your GP may recommend for you will depend on the severity of your pain and other conditions or health problems you have. The main medications used are described below. ","Opioids":"Opioids, such as codeine, are another type of painkiller that may ease your pain if paracetamol does not work. Opioids can help relieve severe pain, but can also cause side effects such as drowsiness, nausea and constipation. Codeine is found in combination with paracetamol in common preparations such as co-codamol. Other opioids that may be prescribed for osteoarthritis include tramadol (brand names include Zamadol and Zydol), and dihydrocodeine (brand name DF 118 Forte). Both come in tablet form and as an injection. Tramadol isn't suitable if you have uncontrolled epilepsy, and dihydrocodeine isn't recommended for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

This may be a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs are painkillers that work by reducing inflammation. There are two types of NSAID and they work in slightly different ways: traditional NSAIDs \u2013 such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac COX-2 inhibitors \u2013 often called coxibs \u2013 such as celecoxib and etoricoxib Some NSAIDs are available as creams (topical NSAIDs) that you apply directly to the affected joints. Some topical NSAIDs are available without a prescription. They can be particularly effective if you have osteoarthritis in your knees or hands. As well as helping to ease pain, they can also help reduce any swelling in your joints. Your doctor will discuss with you the type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with it. NSAID tablets may not be suitable for people with certain conditions, such as asthma, a peptic ulcer or angina, or if you have had a heart attack or stroke. If you're taking low-dose aspirin, ask your GP whether you should use an NSAID. If your GP recommends or prescribes an NSAID to be taken by mouth, they'll usually also prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to take at the same time. NSAIDs can break down the lining in your stomach that protects it against stomach acid. PPIs reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach, reducing the risk of damage to your stomach lining. COX-2 drugs have a lower risk of causing stomach problems, but still need to be used with a PPI if you take them regularly. ","Supportive treatments show":"In addition to lifestyle changes and medication, you may also benefit from a number of supportive treatments that can help reduce your pain and make everyday tasks easier. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) uses a machine that sends electrical impulses through sticky patches, called electrodes, attached to the skin. This may help ease the pain caused by your osteoarthritis by numbing the nerve endings in your spinal cord which control pain. Treatment with TENS is usually arranged by a physiotherapist, who can advise on the strength of the pulses and how long your treatment should last. Applying hot or cold packs (sometimes called thermotherapy or cryotherapy) to the joints can relieve the pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis in some people. A hot-water bottle filled with either hot or cold water and applied to the affected area can be very effective in reducing pain. Special hot and cold packs that can either be cooled in the freezer or heated in a microwave are also available, and work in a similar way. Not using your joints can cause your muscles to waste and may increase stiffness caused by osteoarthritis. Manual therapy is a treatment provided by a physiotherapist. It uses stretching techniques to keep your joints supple and flexible. Read more about physiotherapy. If your osteoarthritis causes mobility problems or difficulty performing everyday tasks, several devices could help. Your GP may refer you to a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist for specialist help and advice. If you have osteoarthritis in your lower limbs, such as your hips, knees or feet, your physiotherapist or occupational therapist may suggest special footwear or insoles for your shoes. Footwear with shock-absorbing soles can help relieve some of the pressure on the joints of your legs as you walk. Special insoles may help spread your weight more evenly. Leg braces and supports also work in the same way. If you have osteoarthritis in your hip or knee that affects your mobility, you may need to use a walking aid, such as a stick or cane. Hold it on the opposite side of your body to your affected leg so that it takes some of your weight. A splint (a piece of rigid material used to provide support to a joint or bone) can also be useful if you need to rest a painful joint. Your physiotherapist can provide you with a splint and give you advice on how to use it correctly. If your hands are affected by osteoarthritis, you may also need assistance with hand-operated tasks, such as turning on a tap. Special devices, such as tap turners, can make performing these tasks far more manageable. Your occupational therapist can give you help and advice about using assistive devices in your home or workplace. Want to know more?

If you need surgery for osteoarthritis, your GP will refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. Having surgery for osteoarthritis may greatly improve your symptoms, mobility and quality of life. However, surgery can't be guaranteed to get rid of your symptoms altogether, and you may still experience pain and stiffness from your condition. There are several different types of surgery for osteoarthritis. Some of the main types of surgery carried out are described below. Joint replacement therapy, also known as an arthroplasty, is most commonly carried out to replace hip and knee joints. During an arthroplasty, your surgeon will remove your affected joint and replace it with an artificial joint (prosthesis) made of special plastics and metal. An artificial joint can last for up to 20 years, although it may eventually need to be replaced. There's also a newer type of joint replacement surgery called resurfacing. This uses only metal components and may be more suitable for younger patients. Your surgeon will discuss with you the type of surgery that would be best. Read more about hip replacement and knee replacement. If joint replacement isn't suitable for you, your surgeon may suggest an operation known as an arthrodesis, which fuses your joint in a permanent position. This means your joint will be stronger and much less painful, although you will no longer be able to move it. If you have osteoarthritis in your knees but you're not suitable for knee replacement surgery, you may be able to have an operation called an osteotomy. This involves your surgeon adding or removing a small section of bone either above or below your knee joint. This helps realign your knee so your weight is no longer focused on the damaged part of your knee. An osteotomy can relieve your symptoms of osteoarthritis, although you may still need knee replacement surgery eventually. Want to know more?

It's the most common type of arthritis in the UK. This topic covers: Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with osteoarthritis Prevention The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are joint pain and stiffness. Some people also experience swelling, tenderness and a grating or crackling sound when moving the affected joints. The severity of osteoarthritis symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints. For some people, the symptoms can be mild and may come and go. Other people can experience more continuous and severe problems which make it difficult to carry out everyday activities. Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis, but the condition most often causes problems in the knees, hips and small joints of the hands. You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe any necessary treatment. Read more about the symptoms of osteoarthritis. As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases, your body repairs the damage itself and you don't experience any symptoms. But in osteoarthritis, the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down, causing pain, swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become inflamed (red and swollen). The exact cause isn't known, but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including: joint injury \u2013 overusing your joint when it hasn't had enough time to heal after an injury or operation other conditions (secondary arthritis) \u2013 osteoarthritis can occur in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout age \u2013 your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older family history \u2013 osteoarthritis may run in families, although studies haven't identified a single gene responsible obesity \u2013 being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, your GP will first ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints. Your GP may suspect osteoarthritis if: you're aged 50 or older you have joint pain that gets worse the more you use your joints you have stiffness in your joints in the morning that lasts less than 30 minutes, or no stiffness at all If your symptoms are slightly different from those listed above, this may indicate another joint condition. For example, prolonged joint stiffness in the morning can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis. Further tests \u2013 such as X-rays or blood tests \u2013 aren't usually necessary, but may be used to rule out other possible causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis or a fractured bone. Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and can't be cured, but it doesn't necessarily get any worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. A number of treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms. Mild symptoms can sometimes be managed with simple measures including: regular exercise losing weight if you're overweight wearing suitable footwear using special devices to reduce the strain on your joints during your everyday activities If your symptoms are more severe, you may need additional treatments such as painkilling medication and a structured exercise plan carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist. In a small number of cases, where the above treatments haven't helped or the damage to the joints is particularly severe, surgery may be carried out to repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint. Read more about treating osteoarthritis. As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, it's important you receive support to help you cope with any issues such as reduced mobility, and advice on any necessary financial support. Some people may find it helpful to talk to their GP or others who are living with osteoarthritis, as there may be questions or worries you want to share. Read about living with osteoarthritis. It's not possible to prevent osteoarthritis altogether. However, you may be able to minimise your risk of developing the condition by avoiding injury and staying as healthy as possible. ","Exercise":"Avoid exercise that puts strain on your joints and forces them to bear an excessive load, such as running and weight training. Instead, try exercises such as swimming and cycling, where your joints are better supported and the strain on your joints is more controlled. Try to do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week to build up your muscle strength and keep yourself generally healthy. Read about health and fitness \u2013 including tips on simple exercises you can do at home. ","Losing weight":"Being overweight or obese can increase the strain on your joints and increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis.

Continuous medication can sometimes help prevent pain, although if your medications have been prescribed \"as required\", you may not need to take them in between painful episodes. If you have any questions or concerns about the medication you're taking or any side effects you think you may be experiencing, talk to your healthcare team. It may also be useful to read the information leaflet that comes with the medication, which will tell you about possible interactions with other drugs or supplements. Check with your healthcare team if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements, as these can sometimes interfere with your medication. Because osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, you'll be in regular contact with your healthcare team. A good relationship with the team means that you can easily discuss your symptoms or concerns. The more the team knows, the more it can help you. People with long-term conditions such as osteoarthritis are often encouraged to get an annual flu jab each autumn to protect against flu.

You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe any necessary treatment. Other symptoms you or your doctor may notice include: joint tenderness increased pain and stiffness when you have not moved your joints for a while joints appearing slightly larger or more 'knobbly' than usual a grating or crackling sound or sensation in your joints limited range of movement in your joints weakness and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk) Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the most common areas affected are the knees, hips and small joints in the hands. Often, you'll only experience symptoms in one joint or a few joints at any one time. If you have osteoarthritis in your knees, both your knees will usually be affected over time, unless it occurred as the result of an injury or another condition affecting only one knee. Your knees may be most painful when you walk, particularly when walking up or down hills or stairs. Sometimes, your knees may \"give way\" beneath you or make it difficult to straighten your legs. You may also hear a soft, grating sound when you move the affected joint. Osteoarthritis in your hips often causes difficulty moving your hip joints. For example, you may find it difficult to put your shoes and socks on or to get in and out of a car. You'll also usually have pain in the groin or outside the hip. This is often worse when you move the hip joints, although it can also affect you when you're resting or sleeping. Osteoarthritis often affects three main areas of your hand: the base of your thumb the joints closest to your fingertips the middle joints of your fingers Your fingers may become stiff, painful and swollen and you may develop bumps on your finger joints. Over time, the pain may decrease and eventually disappear altogether, although the bumps and swelling can remain. Your fingers may bend sideways slightly at your affected joints or you may develop painful cysts (fluid-filled lumps) on the backs of your fingers. In some cases, you may also develop a bump at the base of your thumb where it joins your wrist. This can be painful and you may find it difficult to perform some manual tasks, such as writing, opening jars or turning keys.

However, treatments are available to manage the condition's associated symptoms and any complications that may occur, such as: breathing difficulties caused by underdeveloped lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) high blood pressure (hypertension) liver problems chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure  Treatments for these common problems are described below. If there's a significant risk your baby will be born with underdeveloped lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), particularly if your baby is premature, treatment can begin before they're born. You may be injected with a medication called betamethasone during your pregnancy. This stimulates the development of your baby's lungs and helps them work more efficiently if they're born prematurely. After birth, it's likely your baby will be immediately admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), where they'll be placed on a ventilator (an artificial breathing machine) to assist their breathing. They may also be given a type of medication called a surfactant, which helps prevent tiny air sacs inside the lungs known as alveoli collapsing. The more working alveoli your baby has, the better their ability to breathe. Breathing difficulties can be made worse if your baby's enlarged kidneys press on their diaphragm (the sheet of muscle in the abdomen that helps with breathing). In a few cases, the doctor treating your baby may recommend removing one of their kidneys to relieve the pressure. Despite advances in treatment, pulmonary hypoplasia is a very difficult condition to manage in babies with ARPKD. In some cases, your baby may need to stay in hospital for weeks or months. Even with the best efforts of the medical team, around one in every three babies will die as a result of the condition.  An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is the most widely used treatment for babies and children with high blood pressure. ACE inhibitors reduce blood pressure by reducing the pressure across the filtering units of the kidney (glomeruli). Possible side effects of ACE inhibitors can include: dizziness  tiredness or weakness headaches a persistent dry cough high potassium levels or worsening kidney function (blood tests are needed to monitor this) Most of these side effects should pass in a few days, although some people have a dry cough for longer. A similar group of blood pressure medicines are angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs), which work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors, but don't cause a cough. As well as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there are lots of other medications that may also be used to control blood pressure in children with ARPKD, such as calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics. Read more about treating high blood pressure. Many children with ARPKD also have problems affecting their liver, such as swelling and scarring. Scarring in the liver can make it difficult for blood to flow through it, and this can mean that blood is forced through blood vessels in your child's stomach or gullet (oesophagus) instead. These blood vessels, known as varices, are smaller and more fragile than the blood vessels in the liver and can burst under high blood pressure. If your child has bleeding from these varices, urgent treatment will be needed to stop the bleeding. This will usually involve passing a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope down their mouth and gullet (oesophagus), and either placing a small band around the base of the varices or injecting a special medication \"superglue\" to make the blood clot. If your child has particularly severe liver problems, they may need a liver transplant. If they also need a kidney transplant, both procedures may be combined into a single operation. If your child's condition progresses to a stage where their kidney function is significantly affected, they'll usually need a number of different treatments to manage the various problems this can cause. For example, your child may need treatment for the following problems: anaemia (a lack of iron in the body, which leads to a decreasing number of red blood cells) \u2013 this can be treated with iron supplements, injections of erythropoietin (the hormone the kidneys produce to stimulate red blood cell production), or blood transfusions in severe cases high phosphate levels, which can affect bone health \u2013 this can be treated with a medication called a phosphate binder, which is taken with meals  growth problems \u2013 which can be treated with injections of human growth hormone (HGH), a synthetic version of the hormones used by the body to stimulate growth Read more about treating chronic kidney disease. Most people with ARPKD will eventually develop kidney failure at some point in their life.  More than half of all children who survive the early stages of ARPKD after birth will eventually experience kidney failure by the time they're 15 to 20 years old. When kidney failure occurs, your child will need to have their kidneys replaced or treatment to compensate for their loss of kidney function. There are currently two effective treatments that can be used on a long-term basis: dialysis \u2013 where a machine replicates many functions of the kidneys kidney transplant \u2013 where a kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into a person with kidney failure A person only needs one kidney to survive, so unlike many other types of organ donation, a living person can donate a kidney. Close relatives usually make the best match, so you may want to consider getting yourself tested to see if you're a suitable candidate for donation. You could also ask your relatives if they would consider having themselves tested to see if they could donate one of their kidneys. If your child has ARPKD, their kidneys will be vulnerable to injury. A sudden knock or blow to their kidneys could cause bleeding, leading to severe and intense pain. Your child may therefore be advised to avoid playing contact sports, such as football and rugby. Some over-the-counter medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) painkillers, can also be harmful if your child has ARPKD. Make sure you check with your doctor before giving your child any new medication. Read more about helping your child live with kidney disease and pharmacy remedies and kidney disease.

Over time, either one of these organs may fail. The condition often causes serious problems soon after birth, although less severe cases may not become obvious until a child is older. ARPKD can cause a wide range of problems, including: underdeveloped lungs, which can cause severe breathing difficulties soon after birth high blood pressure (hypertension) excessive peeing and thirst problems with blood flow through the liver, which can lead to serious internal bleeding a progressive loss of kidney function, known as chronic kidney disease (CKD)  When these problems develop, and how severe they are, can vary considerably \u2013 even between family members with the condition. Read more about the symptoms of ARPKD and diagnosing ARPKD. Even though ARPKD is rare, it's one of the most common kidney problems to affect young children. It's estimated that around 1 in 20,000 babies is born with the condition. Both boys and girls are affected equally. ","What causes ARPKD?":"ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver. In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them. Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function. Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow bile (a digestive fluid) to flow out of the liver. The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time. ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents. If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a one in four (25%) chance of each child they have developing ARPKD. The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which usually doesn't cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. ADPKD can be inherited if only one parent carries one of the genetic faults responsible for the condition. Read more about the causes of ARPKD. ","Outlook":"The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably, depending on the severity of the condition. If routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage. However, in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around one in three babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first four weeks after birth. About eight or nine out of 10 babies (80-90%) with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least five years old. It's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates. However, with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood. ","The kidneys":"The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood before passing them out of the body as urine. The kidneys also help maintain blood pressure at a healthy level. Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Information about you":"If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. ","URL":"/conditions/Autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease","Treating ARPKD":"There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause. Treatment for ARPKD may include: breathing assistance with a ventilator (a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs) for children with severe breathing difficulties medication to treat high blood pressure procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements for anaemia.

"},"Causes":{" ":"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is an inherited condition, which means it's passed on to a child from their parents. ARPKD is caused by a DNA mutation (abnormality) in a gene called PKHD1, which produces a protein called fibrocystin that gives the kidney its structure. The faulty PKHD1 gene is responsible for small fluid-filled sacs (cysts) and scarring developing in the kidneys. In some cases, the faulty gene can also cause enlargement and scarring of the liver, or the bile ducts (which produce a digestive fluid called bile) to widen. This can make it difficult for blood to flow through the liver and the bile ducts become more vulnerable to infection. The genetic fault responsible for ARPKD is usually passed on to a child by their parents.  The mutation that causes ARPKD is known as an autosomal recessive mutation. This means that a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If a baby only receives one copy of the mutated gene from one of their parents, he or she won't develop ARPKD, but will carry the mutated gene. It's estimated that 1 in 70 people in the UK is a carrier of the mutated PKHD1 gene. If you're a carrier of the mutated gene and you conceive a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, there's a: 25% chance the baby will receive a pair of normal genes 50% chance the baby will receive one normal gene and one mutated gene, and become a carrier of the PKHD1 mutation 25% chance the baby will receive a pair of mutated genes and develop ARPKD If you have a family history of ARPKD and you're considering trying for a baby, your GP may refer you to a geneticist or genetic counsellor to discuss the risks, benefits and limitations of testing for the condition.

If you have a family history of ARPKD and you're considering having a baby, you may be referred to a genetic counsellor to discuss your options in terms of the tests that can be carried out before and during pregnancy. A genetic counsellor can also discuss the possibility of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. This is where a couple who are both carriers of the ARPKD gene use in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to conceive and the embryos are tested for ARPKD before they're implanted into the womb. In some cases, it may be possible to detect ARPKD during routine ultrasound scans. The kidneys of a baby with ARPKD may appear unusually large or bright on the scan. Early signs of ARPKD are sometimes visible during the first routine ultrasound scan carried out at week 12 of pregnancy, although the condition isn't usually detected until the second routine scan at around 20 weeks. If you have a known family history of ARPKD, it may be possible to be more certain about the diagnosis by testing your and your partner's blood, to see whether you both carry the faulty gene that causes the condition (PKHD1). ARPKD can only be passed on to a child if both parents carry the faulty PKHD1 gene. It's also possible to test the foetus for the genetic mutation, but this involves invasive procedures such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, which carry a risk of miscarriage. Tests that can be used to help diagnose ARPKD after birth include: a physical examination to look for visible signs of ARPKD, such as a swollen abdomen (tummy) blood pressure monitoring an ultrasound scan of the kidneys  a blood test to assess kidney function Genetic testing for the faulty PKHD1 gene that causes ARPKD may also help support a diagnosis, but it isn't routine and is usually only carried out if doctors think there's a possibility that a child's symptoms could be caused by a condition other than ARPKD.

If your baby has the condition, an ultrasound scan may show that: they have enlarged or \"bright\" kidneys their lungs are underdeveloped there's a lack of amniotic fluid surrounding your baby  When your baby is born, there may be clearer signs that suggest they have ARPKD, such as: significant breathing difficulties \u2013 this is caused by the lungs being underdeveloped a swollen abdomen (tummy) \u2013 caused by enlargement of the kidneys Potter's syndrome \u2013 where a lack of amniotic fluid leads to deformities of the limbs, face and ears; Potter's syndrome is a possibility in severe cases of ARPKD  Underdeveloped lungs is the biggest problem immediately after birth and breathing assistance with a ventilator is often needed. A ventilator is a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs. Unfortunately, even with treatment, around one in every three babies with ARPKD who develop breathing difficulties soon after birth will die within a few weeks or months. If a baby survives this stage, the chance of long-term survival is much better and around 90% of those who survive these early stages will live for 10 years. However, about a third of these children will need treatment for kidney failure. ARPKD tends to be less immediately life-threatening in infants and older children, although the condition can still cause a wide range of serious problems. Some of the main problems infants and children with ARPKD experience are described below. ","Chronic kidney disease and kidney failure":"Most people with ARPKD lose a significant amount of kidney function. Loss of kidney function caused by kidney damage is called chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD doesn't usually cause any symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage. The most advanced stage of CKD is known as kidney failure or end-stage renal disease. This occurs when the kidneys have lost almost all of their ability to function. Symptoms of kidney failure can include: poor appetite and weight loss swollen ankles, feet or hands (oedema) shortness of breath an increased need to urinate, particularly at night (nocturia) itchy skin feeling sick Most children with ARPKD will develop kidney failure by the time they're 15 to 20 years old, and they'll need either a kidney transplant or dialysis (where a machine is used to replicate many of the functions of the kidneys). Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Excessive urination and thirst":"In ARPKD, the small tubes (tubules) that make up the kidneys can develop abnormally, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to form within them. The tubules are important in regulating how much water is held in the body. This is disrupted in ARPKD, which is why small children lose excessive amounts of body fluid as urine. This can lead to: polyuria \u2013 passing large amounts of urine, which means your child will need to urinate frequently and may wet the bed polydipsia \u2013 an excessive and prolonged thirst These symptoms increase the risk of dehydration, particularly if the child also has a high temperature, is vomiting, or has diarrhoea. Signs and symptoms of dehydration can include: dry mouth and lips sunken features (particularly the eyes) headaches dizziness irritability Contact your child's kidney specialist if you think your child may be becoming dehydrated, as regular dehydration treatments, including oral rehydration treatments such as Dioralyte, may not be suitable for them. ","High blood pressure":"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common problem for children with ARPKD. If your child has high blood pressure, they'll usually need to take medication to lower it and prevent long-term damage to their heart and blood vessels.  ","Feeding problems":"Your child may have problems feeding because their enlarged kidneys take up most of the space in their abdomen. They may vomit after eating and may only be able to eat small amounts at a time. If this leads to malnourishment, your child may need to be fed through a tube inserted into their stomach, either through the nose or abdomen. ","Faltering growth":"Some children with ARPKD don't grow at a normal rate. Doctors call this faltering growth or failure to thrive, and it's usually caused by a combination of factors. Children with ARPKD are usually under the care of a dietitian, who may recommend a high-calorie and high-protein diet to boost their weight. Some children may also need to be fed through a tube if they're having feeding problems. ","Liver problems and internal bleeding":"For children with ARPKD, a number of problems affecting the liver can also develop. For example, the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow bile (a digestive fluid) to flow out of the liver may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. Over time, the liver can also develop fibrosis (a process similar to scarring). This restricts the blood flow through the liver and increases the pressure in its delicate blood vessels (portal hypertension). When this occurs, blood bypasses the liver and is diverted into veins. These veins then become swollen, particularly in the lower gullet (oesophagus) and if they get too big they can bleed. Portal hypertension also diverts blood to the spleen, causing it to become enlarged. This can affect the spleen's normal functions, such as removing old or damaged blood cells from the blood. An enlarged spleen may remove too many of these cells, including platelets, which can increase the risk of internal bleeding, particularly from any varices that have developed. Platelets are tiny cells that cause the blood to thicken (clot) if a blood vessel is damaged. Internal bleeding can be rapid and severe, causing your child to vomit blood or pass stools that are very dark or tar-like.

This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. ","More information":"Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. ","Lifestyle changes":"If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  ","Medication":"Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure ","Hospital procedures":"In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection).

You may be given an antifungal medicine to treat common fungal infections, such as: ringworm \u2013 a ring-like red rash on the skin of the body or scalp athlete's foot \u2013 which affects the skin on the feet, causing it to become red, flaky and itchy fungal nail infection \u2013 which causes the toenails or fingernails to become thickened, discoloured and sometimes brittle, with pieces of nail breaking off vaginal thrush \u2013 which causes irritation and swelling of the vagina and vulva (the female external sexual organs) some kinds of severe dandruff \u2013 which causes flakes of skin to peel on the head Invasive fungal infections are less common but more serious. They are infections that occur deep inside the body's tissue or in one of the internal organs. Invasive fungal infections can affect the: lungs \u2013 for example, aspergillosis, where a fungus called aspergillus infects the lining of the lungs brain \u2013 for example, fungal meningitis, where a fungus infects the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord People with a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence system) are particularly vulnerable to invasive fungal infections. Those at risk include: people with HIV and AIDS people having high-dose chemotherapy to treat cancer people who are taking medicines to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids; in particular, people who have had an organ transplant will be taking immunosuppressants, making them more vulnerable to fungal infections ","Commonly used antifungal medicines":"There are many different types of antifungal medicines, and you may be familiar with some of the advertised brand names. Many of these brands will contain the same generic antifungal ingredients (alone or in combination). Some of the most common include: clotrimazole econazole miconazole terbinafine fluconazole ketoconazole  amphotericin The packaging should say which antifungal medicine the product contains.

","Getting the right dose of antifungal treatment":"Your GP or pharmacist should advise on how to take or use your antifungal medicine. The patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine will also contain advice on using your medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you take too much of your antifungal medicine. You may be advised to visit your nearest hospital's accident and emergency (A&E) department. If you are advised to go to hospital, take the medicine's packaging with you so the healthcare professionals who treat you know what you have taken.

However, if you have vaginal thrush during pregnancy, your GP may prescribe an antifungal suppository that can be inserted into your vagina (a pessary) or an antifungal cream. ","Contraceptives":"Some antifungal medicines are designed to be used on a man's penis or in or around a woman's vagina. Antifungal creams or vaginal suppositories (pessaries) are sometimes used to treat thrush. However, these types of antifungal medicines can damage latex condoms and diaphragms, making them less effective. If you need to use these types of medication, either use a different method of contraception while you are using the antifungal medicine, or avoid having sex. Some types of antifungal medicines can also interact with oestrogens and progestogens, which are found in some types of hormonal contraceptives, such as the combined contraceptive pill. You may experience some breakthrough bleeding while taking your antifungal medicine, but your contraceptive protection should not be affected. Only oral antifungal medicines interact with oestrogens.

They may decide to use the medicine and monitor you closely. "}},"Antiphospholipid syndrome":{"Treatment":{"Lifestyle changes":"If you're diagnosed with APS, it's important to take all possible steps to reduce your risk of developing blood clots. Effective ways of achieving this include: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet \u2013 low in fat and sugar and containing plenty of fruit and vegetables taking regular exercise maintaining a healthy weight and losing weight if you are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or more) Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Medication":"As part of your treatment you'll be prescribed anticoagulant medicine such as warfarin, or an antiplatelet medication such as low-dose aspirin. These work by interrupting the process of blood clot formation. This means blood clots are less likely to form when they're not needed. Most people with APS need to take anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication daily for the rest of their life. If blood tests show you have abnormal antiphospholipid antibodies, but you don't have a history of blood clots, low-dose aspirin tablets are usually recommended. If you can't take aspirin, you may be prescribed an alternative antiplatelet tablet called clopidogrel. Warfarin tablets are usually recommended if you have APS and a history of blood clots, such as previously having deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a stroke. However, this needs to be changed if you become pregnant or are planning a pregnancy (see below). Tell your doctor if this is the case. If you develop a blood clot or your symptoms suddenly become severe, injections of an anticoagulant called heparin may be needed. These injections may be given in hospital, or you may be trained to give them yourself. Side effects of these medications are uncommon and generally mild, such as indigestion or feeling sick (nausea). However, there's a risk that the disruption to the blood's ability to clot can cause excessive bleeding (a haemorrhage). Symptoms of excessive bleeding can include: blood in your urine or faeces black faeces severe bruising prolonged nosebleeds (lasting longer than 10 minutes) blood in your vomit coughing up blood Contact your GP immediately if you have any of these symptoms while taking an anticoagulant. If this isn't possible, call your local out-of-hours service or NHS 111. ","Treatment during pregnancy":"Women diagnosed with APS are strongly advised to plan for any future pregnancy. This is because treatment to improve the outcome of a pregnancy is most effective when it begins as soon as possible after an attempt to conceive. Some medications used to treat APS can also harm an unborn baby. If you don't plan your pregnancy, it may be several weeks before you realise you're pregnant. This may increase the risk of treatment to safeguard the pregnancy being unsuccessful. Treatment during pregnancy involves taking daily doses of aspirin or heparin, or a combination of both. This depends on whether you have a history of blood clots and previous complications during pregnancy. Warfarin isn't recommended during pregnancy because it carries a small risk of causing birth defects. Treatment with aspirin and/or heparin is usually started at the beginning of the pregnancy and may continue for one to six weeks after you have given birth.

However, most people with APS are aged between 20 and 50, and it affects three to five times as many women as men. It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition. ","What causes antiphospholipid syndrome?":"APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot. It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies. As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part. Read more about the causes of APS. ","Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome":"In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants. Read more about catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).

An anticoagulant medicine such as warfarin or an antiplatelet such as low-dose aspirin is usually prescribed. These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself. Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy. Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives. However, a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment. Read more about treating APS. "},"Complications":{"Complications of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  ":"Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rare but serious complication of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It occurs in less than 1% of people with APS. In people who develop CAPS, blood clots suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. It's not clear what causes this but one case in five occurs after an infection, trauma or surgery. The initial symptoms can be wide-ranging, depending on which organs are involved. Symptoms may include: loss of blood supply to the tips of your fingers or toes, causing them to go dark blue or black swollen ankles, feet or hands increasing breathlessness abdominal (tummy) pain blood in your urine  confusion seizures (fits) coma  The symptoms usually develop suddenly and rapidly get worse. Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance immediately if you or someone you know has APS that suddenly gets worse. Immediate admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is required for people with CAPS so the body's functions can be supported. High-dose anticoagulants are used to stop the blood clots getting bigger while they are slowly absorbed by the body. However, even with the best available treatment, an estimated 50% of people die as a result of the condition.

This increases the risk of blood clots developing in the blood vessels, which can lead to serious health problems, such as: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) strokes heart attacks It's not clear why these abnormal antibodies are produced, or why many people have antiphospholipid antibodies but don't develop blood clots. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible. ","Environmental factors":"It's thought that one or more environmental triggers may be needed to trigger APS in some people. Environmental factors that may be responsible include: viral infections, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) or parvovirus B19 bacterial infections, such as E. coli (a bacteria often associated with food poisoning) or leptospirosis (an infection usually spread by certain animals) certain medications, such as anti-epileptic medicine or the oral contraceptive pill Another theory is that many people with abnormal antiphospholipid antibodies only go on to develop APS if they have a higher risk of developing blood clots. For example, if they: eat an unhealthy diet, leading to high cholesterol levels in the blood don't do enough exercise take the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) smoke are obese However, this doesn't explain why some children and adults who don't have any of these risk factors still develop APS. Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Genetic factors":"Research into the genetics around APS is still at an early stage, but it seems the genes you inherit from your parents may play a role in the development of abnormal antiphospholipid antibodies. APS isn't passed down directly from parents to children in the same way as other conditions, such as haemophilia and sickle cell anaemia. However, having a family member with antiphospholipid antibodies increases the chance of your immune system also producing them. Studies have shown that some people with APS have a faulty gene that plays a role in other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus. This may explain why some people develop APS alongside another immune system condition. ","Antiphospholipid antibodies":"Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to help fight off infection and illness. They're part of the body's defence system and produced to help protect against 'foreign invaders', such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals to kill these bacteria and viruses and to prevent infection spreading. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies which, rather than attacking bacteria and viruses, mistakenly attack proteins found on the outside of cells in the blood and blood vessels. It's not known how this causes the blood to clot more easily. However, most experts believe that keeping your blood at the correct consistency (not too runny and not too sticky) is a delicate balancing act that relies on different types of proteins and fats working together. This balance may be disrupted by the abnormal antibodies in people with APS. ","URL":"/conditions/Hughes-syndrome"},"Title":"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)","Diagnosis":{"Specific blood tests":"To diagnose APS, the blood needs to be tested for the abnormal antiphospholipid antibodies that increase the risk of blood clots. This requires a blood test specifically designed for look for these antibodies. A diagnosis of APS can only be made after two abnormal blood test results, with at least a 12-week gap between them. This is because harmless antiphospholipid antibodies can sometimes develop in the body for short periods of time. Usually this is a result of an infection or a side effect of medication, such as antibiotics. If antiphospholipid antibodies are identified during the first blood test, another test will be needed at a later date to confirm whether the abnormal antibodies are still present. Visit Lab Tests Online for more information about antiphospholipid antibody testing. ","Medical assessment":"If blood tests confirm you have APS, your medical history will be carefully assessed to check whether you've experienced any previous symptoms that may be caused by APS. A diagnosis of APS can usually be confirmed if you've had: one or more confirmed blood clots one or more unexplained late miscarriages, at or after week 10 of your pregnancy one or more premature births, at or before week 34 of your pregnancy three or more unexplained early miscarriages, before week 10 of your pregnancy Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Hughes-syndrome","Diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) ":"An accurate diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is important because blood clots can have serious consequences. Diagnosis of APS is based on the results of specific blood tests and a medical assessment. If APS is suspected, you'll usually be referred to hospital to see either: a haematologist (specialist in conditions affecting the blood) a rheumatologist (specialist in conditions affecting the immune system) "},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) ":"In antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), the immune system produces abnormal antibodies that make the blood 'stickier' than normal. This means people with APS are more likely to develop blood clots in their veins and arteries, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems such as: high blood pressure deep vein thrombosis (DVT) a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or 'mini-stroke' heart attacks pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lungs People with APS may also experience any of the following symptoms: balance and mobility problems vision problems, such as double vision speech and memory problems a tingling sensation or pins and needles in your arms or legs fatigue (extreme tiredness) repeated headaches or migraines ","Livedo reticularis":"Livedo reticularis is a skin condition caused by small blood clots that develop inside the blood vessels of the skin. It causes the skin to take on a blotchy red or blue appearance. Some people also develop ulcers (sores) and nodules (bumps). These symptoms are often more severe in cold weather. ","Superficial thrombophlebitis":"Superficial thrombophlebitis is inflammation of the veins just under your skin, usually in your leg. The symptoms are similar to DVT but they're not usually as severe. The symptoms of superficial thrombophlebitis include: swelling redness and tenderness along the affected vein a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above (although this is less common) The symptoms usually resolve within two to six weeks.

Possible complications include: recurrent (three or more) early miscarriages, usually during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy one or more later miscarriages, usually after week 10 of pregnancy premature birth, usually at or before week 34 of pregnancy, which may be caused by pre-eclampsia (where a woman develops high blood pressure during pregnancy) "}},"ADHD":{"Treatment":{"Therapy":"As well as taking medication, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children, teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating additional problems, such as conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear with ADHD. Some of the therapies that may be used are outlined below. Psychoeducation means that you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and how it affects you. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition. Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD, and may involve teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management, which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD. If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good behaviour, and removal of a privilege for poor behaviour. For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities, and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress. If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to improve their attention and behaviour. You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD. These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10-12 parents. A programme usually consists of 10-16 meetings, which each last up to two hours. They aim to teach parents and carers about behaviour management (see above), while increasing confidence in your ability to help your child and improve your relationship.  Social skills training involves your child taking part in role play situations, and aims to teach them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. A CBT therapist would try to change how your child feels about a situation, which would in turn potentially change their behaviour. CBT can be carried out with a therapist individually or in a group. ","Other possible treatments":"There are other ways of treating ADHD that some people with the condition find helpful, such as cutting out certain foods and taking supplements. However, there's no strong evidence these work, and they shouldn't be attempted without medical advice. People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet. Don't cut out foods before seeking medical advice. Some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. For example, sugar, food colourings and additives, and caffeine are often blamed for aggravating hyperactivity, and some people believe they have intolerances to wheat or dairy products, which may add to their symptoms. If this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour this causes. Discuss this with your GP, who may refer you to a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). Some studies have suggested that supplements of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may be beneficial in people with ADHD, although the evidence supporting this is very limited. It's advisable to talk to your GP before using any supplements, because some can react unpredictably with medication or make it less effective. You should also remember that some supplements shouldn't be taken long term, as they can reach dangerous levels in your body. ","Medication":"There are five types of medication licensed for the treatment of ADHD: methylphenidate  dexamfetamine lisdexamfetamine atomoxetine guanfacine These medications aren't a permanent cure for ADHD, but may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills. Some medications need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended, to assess whether the medication is still needed. In the UK, all of these medications are licensed for use in children and teenagers. Atomoxetine is also licensed for use in adults who had symptoms of ADHD as children. If you weren't diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood, your GP and specialist can discuss which medications and therapies are suitable for you. If you or your child is prescribed one of these medications, you'll probably be given small doses at first, which may then be gradually increased. You or your child will need to see your GP for regular check-ups, to ensure the treatment is working effectively and to check for signs of any side effects or problems. Your specialist will discuss how long you should take your treatment but, in many cases, treatment is continued for as long as it is helping. Methylphenidate is the most commonly used medication for ADHD. It belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants that work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Methylphenidate can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of six. Although methylphenidate isn't licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. The medication can be taken as either immediate-release tablets (small doses taken two to three times a day), or as modified-release tablets (taken once a day in the morning, and they release the dose throughout the day). Common side effects of methylphenidate include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate loss of appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain trouble sleeping headaches stomach aches mood swings Dexamfetamine is also a stimulant medication, which works in a similar way to methylphenidate by stimulating areas of the brain that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Dexamfetamine can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of three. Although it's not licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. Dexamfetamine is usually taken as a tablet once or twice a day, although an oral solution is also available. Common side effects of dexamfetamine include: decreased appetite mood swings agitation and aggression dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Lisdexamfetamine is a similar medication to dexamfetamine, and works in the same way. It can be used by children with ADHD over the age of six if treatment with methylphenidate hasn't helped. You may continue to take it into adulthood if your doctor thinks you're benefitting from treatment. Lisdexamfetamine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once a day. Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include: decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain aggression drowsiness dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Atomoxetine works differently to other ADHD medications. It's known as a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which means it increases the amount of a chemical in the brain called noradrenaline. This chemical passes messages between brain cells, and increasing the amount can aid concentration and help control impulses. Atomoxetine can be used by teenagers and children over the age of six. It's also licensed for use in adults if symptoms of ADHD are confirmed. Atomoxetine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once or twice a day. Common side effects of atomoxetine include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate nausea and vomiting stomach aches trouble sleeping dizziness headaches irritability Atomoxetine has also been linked to some more serious side effects that it's important to look out for, including suicidal thoughts and liver damage. If either you or your child begin to feel depressed or suicidal while taking this medication, speak to your doctor. Guanfacine acts on part of the brain to improve attention and it also reduces blood pressure. It's used for ADHD in teenagers and children if other medicines are unsuitable or ineffective. Guanfacine is usually taken as a tablet once a day, in the morning or evening. Common side effects include: tiredness or fatigue headache abdominal pain dry mouth ","Tips for parents":"Be sure that your GP or specialist helps you understand the difference between ADHD and other problems your child may have. Think about who else needs to know about your child\u2019s ADHD, such as their school or nursery. Find out the side effects of any medication your child takes and what you need to look out for. Getting to know people at local support groups can stop you feeling isolated and unable to cope.   For information on local support groups, contact Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service (ADDISS) or call 020 8952 2800.   Read more about living with ADHD.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. ","How ADHD is treated":"Although there's no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. ","Getting help ":"Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn't necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It's also a good idea to speak to your GP if you're an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren't diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. ","What causes ADHD?":"The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy It's thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have ADHD. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"},"Causes":{"Causes of ADHD ":"The exact cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) isn't fully understood, although a combination of factors is thought to be responsible. ","Brain function and structure":"Research has identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition, although the exact significance of these isn't clear. For example, studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be smaller in people with ADHD, whereas other areas may be larger. Research has also shown that the brain may take an average of two to three years longer to mature in children with ADHD, compared to children who don't have the condition. Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have an imbalance in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain, or that these chemicals may not work properly. ","Genetics":"ADHD tends to run in families and, in most cases, it's thought the genes you inherit from your parents are a significant factor in developing the condition. Research shows that both parents and siblings of a child with ADHD are four to five times more likely to have ADHD themselves. However, the way ADHD is inherited is likely to be complex and isn't thought to be related to a single genetic fault. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder","Other possible causes":"Various other causes have also been suggested as playing a role in the development of ADHD, including: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight brain damage either in the womb or in the first few years of life drinking alcohol, smoking or misusing drugs while pregnant exposure to high levels of toxic lead at a young age However, the evidence for many of these factors is inconclusive, and more research is needed to determine if they contribute to ADHD.

If you're worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP, to find out if they have any concerns about your child's behaviour. Your GP can't formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. When you see your GP, they may ask you: about your symptoms or those of your child when these symptoms started where the symptoms occur \u2013 for example, at home or in school whether the symptoms affect your or your child\u2019s day-to-day life \u2013 for example, if they make socialising difficult if there have been any recent significant events in your life or your child's, such as a death or divorce in the family if there's a family history of ADHD about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have ","Diagnosis in children and teenagers":"Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have six or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have: been displaying symptoms continuously for at least six months started to show symptoms before the age of 12 been showing symptoms in at least two different settings \u2013 for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or parental control symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level symptoms that aren't just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and aren't better accounted for by another condition ","Assessment":"There are a number of different specialists that you or your child may be referred to for a formal assessment, including: a child or adult psychiatrist a paediatrician (a specialist in children's health) a learning disability specialist, social worker or occupational therapist with expertise in ADHD Who you're referred to depends on your age and what's available in your local area. There's no simple test to determine whether you or your child have ADHD, but your specialist can make an accurate diagnosis after a detailed assessment that may include: a physical examination, which can help rule out other possible causes for the symptoms a series of interviews with you or your child interviews or reports from other significant people, such as partners, parents and teachers The criteria for making a diagnosis of ADHD in children, teenagers and adults are outlined below. ","Diagnosis in adults":"Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there's some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults. In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have five or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or five or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, that are listed in diagnostic criteria for children with ADHD. As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults can't be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood. If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, or you weren't diagnosed with ADHD when you were younger, your specialist may wish to see your old school records or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child. For an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms should also have a moderate impact on different areas of their life, such as: underachieving at work or in education driving dangerously difficultly making or keeping friends difficulty in relationships with partners If your problems are recent and didn't occur regularly in the past, you're not considered to have ADHD. This is because it's currently not thought that ADHD can develop for the first time in adults. Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Next steps":"If your GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of \"watchful waiting\" lasting around 10 weeks \u2013 to see if your child's symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse. They may also suggest starting a parent training or education programme to teach you ways of helping your child (see treating ADHD for more information). If your child's behaviour doesn't improve, and both you and your GP believe it's seriously affecting their day-to-day life, your GP should refer you and your child to a specialist for a formal assessment (see below). For adults with possible ADHD, your GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if: you weren't diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since then your symptoms can't be explained by a mental health condition your symptoms have a significant impact on your day-to-day life \u2013 for example, if you're underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person, and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"},"Living with":{"Adults with ADHD":"If you're an adult living with ADHD, you may find the following advice useful: Make lists, keep diaries, stick up reminders and set aside some time to plan what you need to do if you find it hard to stay organised. Let off steam by exercising regularly. Find ways to help you relax, such as listening to music or learning relaxation techniques. If you have a job, speak to your employer about your condition, and discuss anything they can do to help you work better. Talk to your doctor about your suitability to drive, as you'll need to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if your ADHD affects your driving. Contact or join a local or national support group \u2013 these organisations can put you in touch with other people in a similar situation, and they can be a good source of support, information and advice. For more advice, you can read about living with ADHD on the AADD-UK website. AADD-UK is a charity specifically for adults with ADHD. AADD-UK also has a list of adult support groups across the UK. Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Living with ADHD ":"Caring for a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be draining. The impulsive, fearless and chaotic behaviours typical of ADHD can make normal everyday activities exhausting and stressful. ","Ways to cope":"Although it can be difficult at times, it's important to remember that a child with ADHD can't help their behaviour. People with ADHD find it difficult to suppress impulses, which means they don't stop to consider a situation or the consequences before they act. If you're looking after a child with ADHD, you may find the below advice helpful. Plan the day so your child knows what to expect. Set routines can make a difference to how a child with ADHD copes with everyday life. For example, if your child has to get ready for school, break it down into structured steps, so they know exactly what they need to do. Make sure everyone knows what behaviour is expected, and reinforce positive behaviour with immediate praise or rewards. Be clear, using enforceable consequences if boundaries are overstepped (such as taking away a privilege) and follow these through consistently. Give specific praise. Instead of saying a general, \"Thanks for doing that,\" you could say, \"You washed the dishes really well. Thank you.\" This will make it clear to your child that you're pleased, and why. If you're asking your child to do something, give brief instructions and be specific. Instead of asking, \"Can you tidy your bedroom?\" say, \"Please put your toys into the box, and put the books back onto the shelf.\" This makes it clearer what your child needs to do and creates opportunities for praise when they get it right. Set up your own incentive scheme using a points chart or star chart, so good behaviour can earn a privilege. For example, behaving well on a shopping trip will earn your child time on the computer or some sort of game. Involve your child in it and allow them to help decide what the privileges will be. These charts need regular changes or they become boring. Targets should be: immediate (for example, daily) intermediate (for example, weekly) long-term (for example, three-monthly) Try to focus on just one or two behaviours at a time. Watch for warning signs. If your child looks like they're becoming frustrated, overstimulated and about to lose self-control, intervene. Distract your child if possible, by taking them away from the situation, which may calm them down. Keep social situations short and sweet. Invite friends to play, but keep playtimes short, so your child doesn't lose self-control. Don't aim to do this when your child is feeling tired or hungry, such as after a day at school. Make sure your child gets lots of physical activity during the day. Walking, skipping and playing sport can help your child wear themselves out and improve their quality of sleep. Make sure they're not doing anything too strenuous or exciting near to bedtime. Read our page on health and fitness, which includes information on getting active, and how much activity you and your child should be doing. Keep an eye on what your child eats. If your child is hyperactive after eating certain foods, which may contain additives or caffeine, keep a diary of these and discuss them with your GP. Stick to a routine. Make sure your child goes to bed at the same time each night and gets up at the same time in the morning. Avoid overstimulating activities in the hours before bedtime, such as computer games or watching TV. Sleep problems and ADHD can be a vicious circle. ADHD can lead to sleep problems, which in turn can make symptoms worse. Many children with ADHD will repeatedly get up after being put to bed and have interrupted sleep patterns. Trying a sleep-friendly routine can help your child and make bedtime less of a battleground. Read more information about creating a bedtime ritual for better sleep. Children with ADHD often have problems with their behaviour at school, and the condition can have a negative impact on a child's academic progress. Speak to your child's teachers or their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) about any extra support your child may need. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms in children and teenagers":"The symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are well defined, and they're usually noticeable before the age of six. They occur in more than one situation, such as at home and at school. The main signs of each behavioural problem are detailed below. The main signs of inattentiveness are: having a short attention span and being easily distracted making careless mistakes \u2013 for example, in schoolwork appearing forgetful or losing things being unable to stick at tasks that are tedious or time-consuming appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions constantly changing activity or task having difficulty organising tasks The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are: being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings constantly fidgeting being unable to concentrate on tasks excessive physical movement excessive talking being unable to wait their turn acting without thinking interrupting conversations little or no sense of danger These symptoms can cause significant problems in a child's life, such as underachievement at school, poor social interaction with other children and adults, and problems with discipline. ","Symptoms of ADHD ":"The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be categorised into two types of behavioural problems. These categories are: inattentiveness hyperactivity and impulsiveness Most people with ADHD have problems that fall into both these categories, but this isn't always the case. For example, some people with the condition may have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious. ","Related conditions in children and teenagers":"Although not always the case, some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, such as: anxiety disorder \u2013 which causes your child to worry and be nervous much of the time; it may also cause physical symptoms, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating and dizziness oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) \u2013 this is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers conduct disorder \u2013 this often involves a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals depression sleep problems \u2013 finding it difficult to get to sleep at night, and having irregular sleeping patterns autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) \u2013 this affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour epilepsy \u2013 a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits or seizures Tourette\u2019s syndrome \u2013 a condition of the nervous system, characterised by a combination of involuntary noises and movements called tics learning difficulties \u2013 such as dyslexia ","Symptoms in adults":"In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define. This is largely due to a lack of research into adults with ADHD. ADHD is a developmental disorder; it's believed that it can't develop in adults without it first appearing during childhood. But it's known that symptoms of ADHD often persist from childhood into a person's teenage years, and then adulthood. Any additional problems or conditions experienced by children with ADHD, such as depression or dyslexia, may also continue into adulthood. By the age of 25, an estimated 15% of people diagnosed with ADHD as children still have a full range of symptoms, and 65% still have some symptoms that affect their daily lives. The symptoms in children and teenagers, which are listed above, is sometimes also applied to adults with possible ADHD. But some specialists say that the way in which inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness affect adults can be very different from the way they affect children. For example, hyperactivity tends to decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to get worse as the pressure of adult life increases. Adult symptoms of ADHD also tend to be far more subtle than childhood symptoms. Some specialists have suggested the following list of symptoms associated with ADHD in adults: carelessness and lack of attention to detail continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones poor organisational skills inability to focus or prioritise continually losing or misplacing things forgetfulness restlessness and edginess difficulty keeping quiet and speaking out of turn blurting out responses and often interrupting others mood swings, irritability and a quick temper inability to deal with stress extreme impatience taking risks in activities, often with little or no regard for personal safety or the safety of others \u2013 for example, driving dangerously ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder","Additional problems in adults with ADHD":"As with ADHD in children and teenagers, ADHD in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions. One of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that adults may have alongside ADHD include: personality disorders \u2013 conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others bipolar disorder \u2013 a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) \u2013 a condition that causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour The behavioural problems associated with ADHD can also cause problems such as difficulties with relationships, social interaction, drugs and crime.

Sometimes a possible underlying factor is identified, but not always. In children, the condition may occur after a persistent hearing problem at a young age, such as glue ear, which has since passed but has had a permanent effect on how the brain processes sound. It may also be caused by a genetic defect, as some cases seem to run in families. In adults and children, the condition may be associated with damage to the brain from a head injury, stroke, brain tumour or meningitis. Some cases in adults have also been linked to age-related changes in the ability of the brain to process sounds and progressive conditions affecting the nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis. ","How auditory processing disorder is managed":"There's currently no cure for auditory processing disorder, but there are a number of strategies that can help you cope with the condition. Some of these are outlined below. You may be advised to try special activities to help train your brain to analyse sound better, known as auditory training. This can be done either on your own, with a professional, or with the help of a computer programme or CD. It can involve a range of tasks, such as identifying sounds and guessing where they're coming from or trying to focus on specific sounds when there's some slight background noise. The tasks can be adapted for people of different ages, with children often learning through games or from reading with their parents. Be aware of room acoustics and how they affect you. Rooms with hard surfaces will cause echoes, so rooms with carpets and soft furnishings are best. Switch off any radios or televisions and move away from any noisy devices such as fans. If your child has problems hearing, talk to their school about changes that may help them, such as sitting near the teacher, using visual aids and reducing background noise. Your child may also benefit from wearing a radio receiver or having a speaker on their desk at school, which is connected wirelessly to a small microphone worn by their teacher. Alternatively, a speaker system in the class that's connected to the teacher's microphone may help your child hear their teacher over any background noise. It may be useful to tell other people about your hearing problems and let them know what they can do to help you hear more clearly. Ask them to: make sure they get your attention and face you before they talk speak clearly and a little more slowly than normal emphasise their speech to highlight the key points of the message repeat or rephrase the message if necessary   For more information on what you can do to help yourself and how others can help you, you might find the following leaflets helpful: University College London Hospitals NHS Trust: a guide to help your auditory perception (PDF, 305kb) Action on Hearing Loss: children and auditory processing disorder (PDF, 194kb) Page last reviewed: 20/05/2015 Next review due: 20/05/2017 ","Introduction ":"Auditory processing disorder (APD) is a hearing or listening problem caused by the brain not processing sounds in the normal way. It can affect your ability to: pinpoint where a sound is coming from tell which sound comes before another distinguish similar sounds from one another \u2013 such as \"seventy\" and \"seventeen\" understand speech \u2013 particularly if there's background noise, more than one person speaking, the person is speaking quickly, or the sound quality is poor remember instructions you've been told enjoy music Children with the problem may also have difficulty responding to sounds, understanding things they're told, concentrating, and expressing themselves with speech. Their reading and spelling may also be affected. Many people find the condition becomes less of an issue over time as they develop the skills to deal with it. Children may need extra help and support at school, but they can be just as successful as their classmates. ","How your GP can help":"You should visit your GP if you think you or your child may have a hearing problem such as auditory processing disorder. They may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) for some tests. The tests used may include: hearing tests \u2013 you or your child will be asked to listen to a variety of sounds and respond to them questionnaires \u2013 you or your child may be asked questions such as, \"If a friend or family member shouts your name, do you know who is calling without looking to see?\"  electrode tests \u2013 an earbud or headphones are placed in your ear and electrodes are placed on your head to measure your brain's response to sound speech and language assessments and cognitive (thinking) assessments Once auditory processing disorder is diagnosed, you'll be advised about ways you can adapt to the problem. ","Who is affected?":"Auditory processing disorder affects people of all ages. Many cases start in childhood, although it sometimes can develop in adults. Children with auditory processing disorder may have noticeable problems from a very young age, although sometimes the symptoms might not be obvious or only become apparent later on when they start school, college, university or a new job. It's not clear exactly how many people have auditory processing disorder, but it's thought up to 1 in every 20 children may have it to some degree.

It\u2019s caused by a bacterial infection. An abscess at the end of a tooth is called a periapical abscess. An abscess in the gum is called a periodontal abscess. Dental abscesses are often painful, but aren\u2019t always. In either case, they should be looked at by a dentist. It's important to get help as soon as possible, because abscesses don't go away on their own. They can sometimes spread to other parts of the body and make you ill. This page covers: Symptoms of a dental abscess What to do if you have a dental abscess Relieving your symptoms Treatments for a dental abscess What causes dental abscesses? Preventing dental abscesses Symptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include: an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum pain that's worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep redness and swelling in your face a tender, discoloured and/or loose tooth shiny, red and swollen gums sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink bad breath and/or an unpleasant taste in your mouth If the infection spreads, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and feel generally unwell. In severe cases, you may find it hard to fully open your mouth and have difficulty swallowing or breathing. You should see a dentist as soon as possible if you think you have a dental abscess. Avoid visiting your GP, as there is little they can do to help. You can get help from: your registered dentist \u2013 if it's out of hours, they should have an answerphone message with details of how to access out-of-hours dental treatment NHS 111 \u2013 who can give you details of dental services in your area your local accident and emergency (A&E) department \u2013 if there are no other options or you're having difficulty breathing You may have to pay for emergency NHS dental treatment, depending on your circumstances. Read about NHS dental charges. While you're waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain. Ibuprofen is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses, but if you're unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take paracetamol instead. Aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16. If one painkiller doesn't relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16. It may also help to: avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth use a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth These measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn't use them to delay getting help from a dentist. Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus. Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include: removing the affected tooth (extraction) \u2013 this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible root canal treatment \u2013 a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it incision and drainage \u2013 where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed) Local anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). Antibiotics aren't routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe. Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque. If you don't keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to tooth decay or gum disease. The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess: poor oral hygiene \u2013 plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink \u2013 these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums \u2013 bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums having a weakened immune system \u2013 this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and those having treatment, including steroid medication or chemotherapy  You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: use floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day \u2013 spending at least two minutes each time avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away \u2013 just spit out any excess toothpaste cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks \u2013 particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed visit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health  Read more on how to keep your teeth clean and dental check-ups.

Clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, AML. As part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your AML, and AML in general. Search for clinical trials for AML. If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn't licensed for use in the UK and isn't normally available. However, there's no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments. Your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved. Macmillan has more information about unlicensed treatments for AML. ","Consolidation":"If induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation. This often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection. The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months. ","Induction":"The initial treatment you have for AML will largely depend on whether you're fit enough to have intensive chemotherapy, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended. If you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you'll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow. This stage of treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you'll need very close medical and nursing supervision. You'll have regular blood transfusions because your blood won't contain enough healthy blood cells. You'll also be vulnerable to infection, so it's important that you're in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent further infection. Depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from four weeks to a couple of months. You may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve. For intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medications will be injected into a thin tube that's inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart (central line) or into your arm (a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC). In very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is done using a needle that's placed into your spine, in a similar way to a lumbar puncture. Side effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common. They can include:  nausea vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite sore mouth and mouth ulcers (mucositis) tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility \u2013 which may be temporary or permanent (see complications of AML for more information) Most side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy. If your doctors don\u2019t think you're fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment. This involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy, which is designed more to control leukaemia rather than cure it. The main aim of this treatment is to control the level of cancerous cells in your body and limit any symptoms you have, while reducing your risk of experiencing significant side effects of treatment. The medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis. If you have the sub-type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you'll usually be given capsules of a medicine called ATRA, in addition to chemotherapy. ATRA works by changing the immature white blood cells (blast cells) into mature healthy cells, and can reduce symptoms very quickly. Side effects of ATRA can include headaches, nausea, bone pain, and dry mouth, skin and eyes. ","Other treatments":"Many other treatments are used for AML, as described below.  Radiotherapy involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat AML: to prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant (see below) to treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommon Side effects of radiotherapy can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. If chemotherapy doesn't work, a possible alternative treatment option is a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. The donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication. This process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type. Transplantations are most successful when they're carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there's a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister. Read about bone marrow donation. Azacitidine is a possible alternative treatment for adults with AML who can't have a stem cell transplant. It's recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in certain circumstances \u2013 for example, depending on the characteristics of the person's blood and bone marrow. Azacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that's given by injection under the skin. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells. NICE has more information about azacitidine for the treatment of AML. ","Treating acute myeloid leukaemia ":"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed. As AML is a complex condition, it's usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) \u2013 a group of different specialists working together (see below). ","Your care team":"A treatment team for AML may include a: haemato-oncologist (specialist in the non-surgical treatment of leukaemia) haemato-pathologist (specialist in the study of cancerous blood cells) paediatrician (specialist in treating children) pharmacist social worker psychologist specialist cancer nurse (who will serve as the first point of contact between you and the members of your care team) counsellor Page last reviewed: 14/03/2016 Next review due: 01/03/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Leukaemia-acute","Your treatment plan":"Treatment for AML is often carried out in two stages: Induction \u2013 the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have. Consolidation \u2013 this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body. The induction stage of treatment isn't always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin. If you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. This may be the same as your first treatment, although it's likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant (see below). If you're thought to have a high risk of experiencing complications of AML treatment \u2013 for example, if you're over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition \u2013 less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. This is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.  "},"Introduction":{"What causes AML?":"AML occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones), produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells. Blast cells don't have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). It's not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. However, a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include: previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous  radiotherapy treatment) exposure to benzene \u2013 a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as Down's syndrome Read more about the causes of AML. ","How AML is treated":"AML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure. Read more about treating AML. ","Introduction ":"Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The two main types of white blood cells are: lymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage  This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ","Outlook":"The outlook for AML largely depends on the specific type of AML you have, as well as your age and general health. There are many subtypes of AML, which are classified according to various features \u2013 such as the specific genetic changes in the leukaemia cells. Some types of AML are more challenging to treat than others. Even if treatment is initially successful, there's still a significant risk that the condition will return at some point during the next few years. If this happens, treatment may need to be repeated. A number of medical trials have suggested that almost half of those aged under 60 diagnosed with AML will live for at least five years, and in some types of AML, such as acute promyeloid leukaemia (APML), around 85% will live for at least five years. In general, the outlook for children with AML tends to be better than that of adults diagnosed with the condition. Page last reviewed: 14/03/2016 Next review due: 01/03/2019 ","Who's affected":"AML is a rare type of cancer, with around 2,600 people diagnosed with it each year in the UK. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 65. ","Signs and symptoms of AML":"The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include: pale skin tiredness breathlessness frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding. Read more about the complications of AML. ","Seeking medical advice":"You should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated. If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment. Read more about diagnosing AML. ","URL":"/conditions/Leukaemia-acute"},"Complications":{"Weakened immune system":"Having a weakened immune system \u2013 being immunocompromised \u2013 is a common complication of AML. Even if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medications that are used to treat AML can temporarily weaken your immune system. This means you're more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual. Complications arising from infection are the leading cause of death in people with AML. However, if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment. Therefore, you may be advised to: take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections maintain good personal and dental hygiene avoid contact with anyone who's known to have an infection \u2013 even if it's a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles check with your GP to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although you won't be able to have any vaccine that contains \"live\" viruses or bacteria, such as the shingles vaccine and MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) Report any possible symptoms of an infection to your treatment unit immediately because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications. Symptoms of an infection can include: a high temperature (fever) a headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness ","Infertility":"Many of the treatments that are used to treat AML can cause infertility. This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent. People particularly at risk of permanent infertility are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Your treatment team can give a good estimation of the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances. It may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have their sperm samples stored. Similarly, women can have eggs or fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb, following treatment. However, as AML is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, there may not always be time to do this before treatment needs to start. Page last reviewed: 14/03/2016 Next review due: 01/03/2019 ","Complications of acute myeloid leukaemia ":"If you have acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), you may experience a number of complications. These can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment. Some of the main complications associated with AML are outlined below. ","URL":"/conditions/Leukaemia-acute","Bleeding":"If you have AML, you'll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive. People with advanced AML are more vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition. Serious bleeding can occur: inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) \u2013 causing symptoms such as a severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) \u2013 causing symptoms such as coughing up blood, breathing difficulties and a bluish skin tone (cyanosis) inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) \u2013 causing symptoms such as vomiting blood and passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like in colour All these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring. "},"Causes":{"Causes of acute myeloid leukaemia ":"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells. The mutation causes the stem cells to produce many more white blood cells than are needed. The white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don't have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. These immature cells are known as \"blast cells\". As the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it's this fall that causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia. ","Increased risk":"It's not known what triggers the genetic mutation in AML, although a number of different factors that can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified. The main risk factors for AML are outlined below. Being exposed to a significant level of radiation can increase your chances of developing AML, although this usually requires exposure at very high levels. For example, rates of AML are higher in people who survived the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945. In the UK, most people are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause AML. However, some people who have had radiotherapy as part of their treatment for previous cancer (see below) can be the exception. Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for AML in adults. Benzene is found in petrol, and it's also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. Benzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing AML. Treatment with radiotherapy and certain chemotherapy medications for an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing AML many years later. Leukaemia that develops as a result of previous cancer treatment is called \"secondary leukaemia\" or \"treatment-related leukaemia\". People with certain blood disorders \u2013 such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or polycythaemia vera (PCV) \u2013 have an increased risk of developing AML. People with certain genetic disorders, including Down\u2019s syndrome and Fanconi\u2019s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia.   A number of other environmental factors that could trigger AML have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. However, there's no clear evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing AML.

This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.  The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. In some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together. You won't feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. The bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have. ","Coping with your diagnosis":"Dealing with a diagnosis of leukaemia isn't easy. Being diagnosed with AML can be particularly difficult, because the condition usually comes on suddenly and treatment has to be started quickly. This can be upsetting and confusing. However, finding out what type of leukaemia you have, what treatment you need and how treatment will affect you can help you cope better and feel more in control. The Cancer Research UK website has more information and advice about coping with AML. Page last reviewed: 14/03/2016 Next review due: 01/03/2019 ","Diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia ":"In the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), your GP will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have blood tests. A high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. If this is the case, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions). A haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined below. ","URL":"/conditions/Leukaemia-acute","Further tests":"Additional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your AML. They can also provide an insight into how the condition should be treated. These tests are described below. Genetic tests can be carried out on blood and bone marrow samples to identify the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. There are many specific genetic variations that can occur in AML, and knowing the exact type of AML you have can help doctors make decisions about the most appropriate treatment. For example, people who have a type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are known to respond well to a medicine called All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA). If you have AML, a computerised tomography (CT) scan, X-ray or echocardiogram (an ultrasound scan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy. These tests are carried out because it's important for doctors to assess your general health before they can decide on the most appropriate treatment for you. In rare situations where it's thought there's a risk that AML has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture may be carried out. In this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are found in your nervous system, you may need to have injections of chemotherapy medication directly into your cerebrospinal fluid as part of your treatment.

In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis. Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks. Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life. The main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body \u2013 most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended. Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood. The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed. Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone. ","Introduction ":"Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people of all ages, including children (see below). ","Types of arthritis":"The two most common types of arthritis are: osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people. It most often develops in adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hips In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men. Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.  The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.  Ankylosing spondylitis \u2013 a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints. Cervical spondylosis \u2013 also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness. Fibromyalgia \u2013 causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons. Lupus \u2013 an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues. Gout \u2013 a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness and swelling. Psoriatic arthritis \u2013 an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with psoriasis. Enteropathic arthritis \u2013 a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. About one in five people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine. Reactive arthritis \u2013 this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through). It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection. Secondary arthritis \u2013 a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards. Polymyalgia rheumatica \u2013 a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause joint inflammation. ","Treating arthritis":"There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition. For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including: painkillers non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended: arthroplasty (joint replacement) arthodesis (joint fusion) osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned) Read more about how osteoarthritis is treated. Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include: analgesics (painkillers) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \u2013 a combination of treatments is often recommended physiotherapy  regular exercise  Read more about how rheumatoid arthritis is treated.

","Gallstones":"The most effective way of preventing gallstones is eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least five portions a day). Your diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. This helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body.  There is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones. Because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it's advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content. Foods high in cholesterol include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter and lard cakes and biscuits Being overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also help reduce your risk of developing the condition. See exercise, healthy eating and losing weight for more information and advice. ","Alcohol":"Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your pancreas being damaged, and reduce your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. It can also lower your chances of developing other serious conditions, such as liver cancer. men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine or an alcopop is 1.5 units. Read the pages on drinking and alcohol for more information and advice. Page last reviewed: 02/03/2015 Next review due: 01/03/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Pancreatitis"},"Treatment":{"Fluids":"Your body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or IV, fluid). In severe cases of acute pancreatitis, IV fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body. ","Oxygen":"To ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving. In severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing. ","Treating the underlying cause":"Once the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated. Treatments for the most common causes of acute pancreatitis \u2013 gallstones and alcohol consumption \u2013 are outlined below. If a gallstone is responsible for the pancreatitis, you may need a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or your gallbladder may need to be removed. Gallbladder removal surgery may be done while you're in hospital, or it may be planned for several weeks' time. Having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods. An ERCP procedure is an alternative treatment for gallstones. It involves using a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. X-rays guide the endoscope into your digestive system, and surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope to remove the gallstones. After recovering from acute pancreatitis, alcohol should be completely avoided if this was the cause of the condition. If you find this difficult, you'll probably need additional treatment. Treatment options for alcohol dependence include: one-to-one counselling self-help groups \u2013 such as Alcoholics Anonymous a medication called acamprosate \u2013 which helps to reduce your alcohol cravings Read more about treating alcohol misuse. Page last reviewed: 02/03/2015 Next review due: 01/03/2018 ","Treating acute pancreatitis ":"Acute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you'll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen. Many people are well enough to leave hospital after 5-10 days. In severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you'll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (ICU). In these cases, recovery may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal. Read about the potential complications of acute pancreatitis for more information on severe cases. ","Nutritional support":"Although the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn't restricted, some people are advised not to eat. This is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas. Depending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods for a few days or longer. If you need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be used to provide your body with nutrients. This is known as enteral feeding and often involves using a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube). ","Painkillers":"Acute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine.  Some of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. If you're visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don't be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive. ","URL":"/conditions/Pancreatitis"},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal. Acute pancreatitis is different to chronic pancreatitis, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years. The most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include: suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) feeling or being sick diarrhoea Read more about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and diagnosing acute pancreatitis. ","Complications":"About four out of five cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and don't cause any serious further problems. However, one in five cases are severe and can result in life-threatening complications, such as multiple organ failure. In severe cases where complications develop, there's a high risk of the condition being fatal. In England, just over 1,000 people die from acute pancreatitis every year. If a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it's likely to be several weeks or months before they're well enough to leave hospital. Read more about the possible complications of acute pancreatitis. Page last reviewed: 02/03/2015 Next review due: 01/03/2018 ","Who is affected?":"Acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age. Men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones. In England, more than 25,000 people were admitted to hospital with acute pancreatitis between 2013 and 2014.  ","How it's treated":"Treatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed. This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5-10 days. However, recovery takes longer in severe cases, as complications that require additional treatment may develop. Read more about treating acute pancreatitis. ","When to seek medical help":"Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible, contact NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service for advice. ","URL":"/conditions/Pancreatitis","Why it happens":"It's thought that acute pancreatitis occurs when a problem develops with some of the enzymes (chemicals) in the pancreas, which causes them to try to digest the organ. Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to: gallstones \u2013 which accounts for around half of all cases alcohol consumption \u2013 which accounts for about a quarter of all cases By reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis. Read more about the causes of acute pancreatitis and preventing acute pancreatitis. "},"Complications":{"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)":"Another common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis. In SIRS, the inflammation affecting the pancreas spreads throughout the body, which can cause one or more organs to fail. It usually develops during the first week after the symptoms start, with most cases developing on the same day. Symptoms of SIRS include: a rise in body temperature to above 38C (100.4F) or a fall in body temperature to below 36C (96.8F) a rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute an unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute) There's currently no cure for SIRS, so treatment involves trying to support the body's functions until the inflammation has passed. The outcome depends on how many organs fail. The higher the number of organs affected, the greater the risk of death. ","Chronic pancreatitis":"If you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life. Page last reviewed: 02/03/2015 Next review due: 01/03/2018 ","Complications of acute pancreatitis ":"Although most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications. ","Infected pancreatic necrosis":"In around one in three severe cases of acute pancreatitis, a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs. In infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. Without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. Necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue. The dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. Once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood (blood poisoning) and cause multiple organ failure. If left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal. Infected pancreatic necrosis usually develops two to six weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis starts. Symptoms include increased abdominal pain and a high temperature. The infection is treated with injections of antibiotics, and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning. In some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin. Alternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used. A small cut is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. If laparoscopic surgery isn't possible, a cut can be made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed. Infected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. Even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around one in five. ","Pseudocysts":"Pseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. They're a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition. Pseudocysts usually develop four weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis start. In many cases, they don't cause any symptoms and are only detected during a computerised tomography (CT) scan. However, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating, indigestion and a dull abdominal (tummy) pain. If the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for further treatment, as they usually go away on their own. Treatment is usually recommended if you're experiencing symptoms or if the pseudocysts are large. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection. Pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into it through your skin. This can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid. ","URL":"/conditions/Pancreatitis"},"Causes":{"Causes of acute pancreatitis ":"Most cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn't always clear. ","Alcohol consumption":"It's not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. One theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it. Whatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. A very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol a week were four times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or four bottles of wine a week). Binge drinking, which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. ","Gallstones":"Gallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. They can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas. The blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. These enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they can start to digest the pancreas instead if the opening is blocked. However, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. Most gallstones don't cause any problems. ","Other causes":"Less common causes of acute pancreatitis include: accidental damage or injury to the pancreas \u2013 for example, during a procedure to remove gallstones or examine the pancreas certain types of medication, such as some antibiotics or chemotherapy medication \u2013 acute pancreatitis can be an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people a viral infection \u2013 such as mumps or measles a complication of cystic fibrosis certain rare conditions \u2013 including hyperparathyroidism, Reye's syndrome and Kawasaki disease ","Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.":"Gallstones are the most common cause of emergency hospital admission for people with abdominal pain.

Factors thought to increase your risk include: being 70 years of age or over being obese (a person is considered obese if they have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above) having two or more alcoholic drinks a day smoking Researchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the MCP-1 mutation, are eight times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. A genetic mutation is where the instructions (DNA) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics. ","URL":"/conditions/Pancreatitis"},"Title":"Acute pancreatitis","Diagnosis":{"Further testing":"Several tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and assess your risk of developing more serious complications. You may have any of the following tests: a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of your pancreas a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body an ultrasound scan \u2013 where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) An ERCP uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. The endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. A special dye that shows up on X-rays is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, X-rays will be taken. This test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. In some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed.

The doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. They may also carry out a physical examination. If you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch. A blood test will be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. This can detect signs of acute pancreatitis, such as a high level of two chemicals called lipase and amylase. At first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. You'll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure. People with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. People with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems.

This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods. Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain. Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6-12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.

It's usually caused by a nasal condition or brain injury, but some people are born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia). Losing your sense of smell can be very depressing and isolating. It means missing out on many experiences most of us take for granted, such as smelling fresh flowers, perfume or the scent of a loved one. Smell also plays an important role in how you taste things. Many people with anosmia lose interest in food, because 80% of the flavour of food comes from its smell. If you've suddenly lost your sense of smell and don't know why, see your GP. They may be able to diagnose an underlying cause (see below) and offer treatment to restore your sense of smell. ","Safety":"If you have anosmia, you'll need to take special precautions because you won't be able to smell fires, poisonous fumes, leaking gas or food that has gone off. It's recommended that you: install smoke alarms in all areas of the home, especially in the kitchen and near the fireplace change from natural gas appliances to electric or consider installing a natural gas detector clearly mark expiry dates on food and mark leftovers with dates, so you know when to throw them away carefully read warning labels on products such as bathroom and kitchen cleaners, and insecticides, to be aware of potent chemicals Some people with anosmia also experience a loss of appetite, but it's important to maintain your nutrition levels. It may help to set reminders for mealtimes and weigh yourself regularly to ensure you stay healthy. Page last reviewed: 11/02/2015 Next review due: 01/02/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/anosmia","Seeing your GP":"Your GP will want to take your full medical history, examine the inside of your nose and take a blood sample for testing in a laboratory. Your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist in hospital. Further tests, such as a CT scan, MRI scan or nasal endoscopy (where a thin tube with a camera is inserted up your nose), can be used to investigate the cause. ","What are the causes?":"There are several medical conditions and medications associated with a loss of smell. The possible causes include: a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold persistent (chronic) sinusitis, with or without nasal polyps a nose abnormality, such as a crooked nose or a nasal septum (wall dividing the nostrils) that isn't straight hay fever (rhinitis) that causes severe inflammation of the nasal passages certain medication, including antibiotics such as metronidazole recreational drug use such as cocaine or amphetamines diabetes long-term alcohol misuse an underactive thyroid Cushing's syndrome (high levels of the hormone cortisol in the blood) exposure to a chemical that burns the inside of the nose a head injury a brain tumour radiotherapy to the head and neck epilepsy Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease stroke liver or kidney disease vitamin B12 deficiency schizophrenia granulomatosis with polyangiitis \u2013 an uncommon disorder of the blood vessels sarcoidosis \u2013 a rare disease that causes body cells to form into clumps In general, anosmia is usually caused by either a problem with odours getting to the top of the nose (because of swelling or a blockage in the nose) or a problem with nerve signals from the nose to the brain. However, in around 20% of cases, the cause can't be found. This is known as idiopathic anosmia. An estimated 6,000 people in the UK are born without a sense of smell because of a genetic condition or faulty gene. This is known as congenital anosmia. It can occur alone (isolated congenital anosmia) or it can be a symptom of another genetic condition, such as Kallmann syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome. ","Can anosmia be cured?":"Whether or not anosmia can be cured depends on the underlying cause. People with congenital anosmia have a lifelong inability to smell and have no concept of what a smell even is. Currently, there's no known cure or treatment for congenital anosmia. However, other types of anosmia may be improved or cured when the underlying condition is treated. For example, if the cause is swelling in the nose or sinuses, steroids can usually clear this up and restore your sense of smell. Treatments that may help, depending on your condition, are: nasal washing (douching) a steroid nasal spray an antihistamine steroid tablets an operation to have nasal polyps removed an operation to straighten the nasal septum an operation to clear out the sinuses, called endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) (see below) These treatments may come with unpleasant side effects. Speak to your doctor about whether any of these treatments may be suitable for you and, if so, what side effects you may experience. In bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), the surgeon opens all your sinuses and clears them out to reduce inflammation and allow nasal rinses and sprays to reach them. In some centres, this may involve the use of an image guidance system (IGS) to map out your sinuses. ESS also involves removing any polyps present at the same time. This treatment can bring back some sense of smell for many people with anosmia when medication alone has failed. However, if you don't keep taking your nasal medications afterwards, the anosmia is likely to return. If you've had surgery to remove nasal polyps, it's quite common for these to grow back, and many people find they need another operation. However, ESS may reduce the need for further surgery. A recent journal publication looked at how successful ESS with IGS was in treating patients with chronic frontal sinusitis, some of whom also had nasal polyps. Data from a five-year period showed that only four patients out of 141 (3%) needed to have further surgery after having ESS with IGS as their first operation. IGS is not available in all hospitals, but may be performed by specialist centres where possible.

It can be difficult to know which intervention will work best for your child, because each person with ASD is affected differently. Some types of intervention can involve hours of intensive work, and this isn't always possible for many families because of the practical, emotional and financial commitments necessary. The National Autistic Society website has information about the many different strategies and approaches available for ASD. Any intervention should focus on important aspects of your child's development. These are: communication skills \u2013 such as using pictures to help communicate (as speech and language skills are usually significantly delayed) social interaction skills \u2013 such as the ability to understand other people's feelings and respond to them imaginative play skills \u2013 such as encouraging pretend play academic skills \u2013 the \"traditional\" skills a child needs to progress with their education, such as reading, writing and maths The detailed assessment, management and co-ordination of care for children and young people with ASD should involve local specialist community-based multidisciplinary teams (sometimes called \"local autism teams\") working together. The team may include: a paediatrician mental heath specialists, such as a psychologist and psychiatrist a learning disability specialist a speech and language therapist an occupational therapist education and social care services Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with ASD has a case manager or key worker to manage and co-ordinate their treatment, care and support, as well as their transition into adult care. The Research Autism website provides details of the many different types of autism interventions, treatments and therapies. ","Medication":"In some cases, medication may be prescribed to treat some of the symptoms or conditions associated with ASD. For example: sleeping problems \u2013 this may be treated with a medication such as melatonin depression \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) epilepsy \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication called an anticonvulsant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \u2013 this may be treated with a medication such as methylphenidate aggressive and challenging behaviour, such as tantrums or self-harming \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication called an antipsychotic if the behaviour is severe or psychological treatments haven't helped These medications can have significant side effects and are usually only prescribed by a doctor who specialises in the condition being treated. If medication is offered, your child will have regular check-ups to assess whether it's working. ","Psychosocial treatments":"If your child's behaviour is causing problems, they'll be assessed for possible triggers, such as a physical health condition, mental health problem, or environmental factors. A physical or mental cause will be addressed using medication and/or psychological treatments. In some cases, such as where a child with ASD also has an anxiety problem, a psychosocial treatment may also be recommended. These are supportive treatments that help people overcome challenges and maintain good mental health. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides more information about interventions for challenging behaviour. ","Treatments not recommended":"A number of alternative treatments have been suggested for ASD. However, these should be avoided, because there's little or no evidence that they're effective and some may even be potentially dangerous. Treatments that aren't recommended for ASD include: special diets \u2013 such as gluten-free or casein-free diets neurofeedback \u2013 where brain activity is monitored (usually by placing electrodes on the head) and the person being treated can see their brain activity on a screen and is taught how to change it auditory integration training \u2013 a therapy that involves listening to music that varies in tone, pitch and volume chelation therapy \u2013 which uses medication or other agents to remove metal (in particular, mercury) from the body hyperbaric oxygen therapy \u2013 treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber facilitated communication \u2013 where a therapist or another person supports and guides a person's hand or arm while using a device such as a computer keyboard or mouse ","Funding treatments":"Some of the interventions for ASD take a lot of time and labour, and can cost a significant amount of money if not available on the NHS. Many local education authorities (LEAs) provide partial or sometimes total funding towards specialist education and training, but this varies widely between LEAs. Read more about Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND). If you would like more information and advice about what funding is available and how to request it, The National Autistic Society runs a special service called the Education Rights Service.

If your child has ASD, it's a good idea to find out as much as you can about the condition. The National Autistic Society website provides useful information and advice for parents, relatives and carers. The Research Autism website is also a good source of information and has a section about the different issues that living with autism presents, including the impact of autism on the family. Communication is particularly challenging for children with ASD. Helping your child to communicate can reduce anxiety and improve behaviour. The following tips may be useful when communicating and interacting with your child: use your child's name, so they know you're addressing them keep background noise to a minimum keep language simple speak slowly and clearly, with pauses between words accompany what you say with simple gestures allow extra time for your child to process what you've said  In-depth advice and support programmes are available for parents of children recently diagnosed with ASD. For example, the EarlyBird programme provided by The National Autistic Society is a free three-month course for parents whose child has been diagnosed with ASD, but hasn't started school yet. The programme aims to inform and support parents, and offers practical advice about looking after their child and helping them improve their skills. EarlyBird Plus is for parents of children who have received a later diagnosis of ASD and are four to eight years of age. The programme aims to address the child's needs at both home and school by training parents and carers, together with a professional who regularly works with their child. EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus programmes are run by licensed teams and are available in most parts of the UK. To find out if there's a team in your area, call 01226 779218 or email earlybird@nas.org.uk. "},"Introduction":{"Getting a diagnosis":"The main features of ASD \u2013 problems with social communication and interaction \u2013 can often be recognised during early childhood. Some features of ASD may not become noticeable until a change of situation, such as when the child starts nursery or school. See your GP or health visitor if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of ASD in your child, or if you're concerned about your child's development. It can also be helpful to discuss your concerns with your child's nursery or school. Read more about diagnosing ASD. ","Signs and symptoms":"People with ASD tend to have problems with social interaction and communication. In early infancy, some children with ASD don\u2019t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others \u2013 for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They\u2019ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. They can find it hard to understand other people's emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won\u2019t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don\u2019t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they\u2019re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking), learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression. About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these, 50% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of people with \"severe learning difficulties\" have an ASD. Read more about the symptoms of ASD. ","Introduction ":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a range of similar conditions, including Asperger syndrome, that affect a person's social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. It's estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. There's no \"cure\" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. Read about help and support available for people with ASD. ","Autism in adults":"Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. For example, a number of autism-specific services are available that provide adults with ASD with the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities. Read more about adults with ASD. Page last reviewed: 06/01/2016 Next review due: 01/09/2018 ","Caring for someone with ASD":"Being a carer isn't an easy role. When you're busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. If you're caring for someone else, it's important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you care for.

","URL":"/conditions/autistic-spectrum-disorder","What causes ASD?":"The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it's thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. In the past, some people believed the MMR vaccine caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. Read more about the causes of ASD. "},"Causes":{"Environmental triggers":"Some researchers believe that a person born with a genetic vulnerability to ASD only develops the condition if they're exposed to a specific environmental trigger. Possible triggers include being born prematurely (before 35 weeks of pregnancy), or being exposed in the womb to alcohol or to certain medication, such as sodium valproate (sometimes used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy). No conclusive evidence has been found linking pollution or maternal infections in pregnancy with an increased risk of ASD. ","Genes":"Most researchers believe that certain genes a child inherits from their parents could make them more vulnerable to developing ASD. Cases of ASD have been known to run in families. For example, younger siblings of children with ASD can also develop the condition, and it's common for identical twins to both develop ASD. No specific genes linked to ASD have been identified, but it may be a presenting feature of some rare genetic syndromes, including Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and Angelman syndrome. ","Causes of autism spectrum disorder ":"The exact cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently unknown. It's a complex condition and may occur as a result of genetic predisposition (a natural tendency), environmental or unknown factors. ","Other health conditions":"Below are some other conditions known to be associated with ASD: muscular dystrophy \u2013 a group of inherited genetic conditions that gradually cause the muscles to weaken Down's syndrome \u2013 a genetic condition that typically causes a learning disability and a range of physical features cerebral palsy \u2013 conditions that affect the brain and nervous system, causing problems with movement and co-ordination infantile spasms \u2013 a type of epilepsy that develops while a child is still very young (usually before they're one year old) neurofibromatosis \u2013 a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2) the rare genetic conditions fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome  ","URL":"/conditions/autistic-spectrum-disorder","Misconceptions about the causes of ASD":"In the past, a number of things were linked to ASD, but extensive research has found no evidence to suggest that any of these contribute to the condition. These include: the MMR vaccine thiomersal \u2013 a compound that contains mercury, which is used as a preservative in some vaccines the way a person has been brought up diet, such as eating gluten or dairy products Page last reviewed: 06/01/2016 Next review due: 01/09/2018 "},"Title":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)","Adults with autism":{"Caring for an adult with ASD":"Many adults with ASD continue to live in their family home, and some are cared for by family members. Caring for anyone with a disability can be challenging, and parents may need additional support. If you're caring for an adult with ASD, you may consider respite care. This is short-term care provided either in or outside the family home. It is funded by your local authority and gives families and carers of people with ASD a break from their daily care routine. For more information, see your guide to care and support and carers' breaks and respite care. Page last reviewed: 06/01/2016 Next review due: 01/09/2018 ","Adults living with autism ":"Some people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) grow up without their condition being recognised, sometimes through choice. However, a diagnosis can make it easier to access a range of support services that may be available locally. It's never too late to be diagnosed with ASD, although it's not always easy because some local NHS authorities don't provide NHS funding for diagnosing ASD in adults. Read more about diagnosing ASD in adults, or see The National Autistic Society website for further information about autism diagnosis for adults. ","Employment":"It can be difficult for people with ASD to find a job. For example, they may find the work environment too noisy, or travelling to work may be too stressful because of the crowds. Sudden changes in routine can also be upsetting. However, in the right job and with the right support, people with ASD have much to offer. They're often accurate, reliable, and have a good eye for detail. Being in a working environment can help the individual's personal development tremendously.  Read about disability in the workplace and the Equality Act. If you're having problems getting a job or staying in a job, you may be able to access a supported employment programme in your local area. These programmes can help you write your CV and job applications, and prepare you for interviews. They can also help you choose which jobs would suit you and provide training for that role. Those providing the programme can also advise employers about any changes that need to be made to the workplace to suit people with ASD, as well as supporting you and the employer before and after you've started work. See The National Autistic Society website to find help with getting a job. ","Making decisions":"Someone with ASD may have the capacity to make some decisions (for example, to decide what items to buy at the local shop), but lack capacity to make other decisions (for example, making decisions about complex financial issues). Where someone is judged not to have the capacity to make a specific decision after they've had a capacity assessment, that decision can be taken for them \u2013 but it must be in their best interests. For more information, read What is the Mental Capacity Act? ","Benefits":"Adults diagnosed with ASD can also claim some benefits, such as the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). This is the new benefit replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for people with a disability who are aged 16 to 64. You can find out more about benefits for adults with autism on The National Autistic Society website, or you can visit GOV.UK to read more about benefits. ","Accommodation":"Adults with ASD can live in all types of housing. Some people may be suited to a residential care home, while others may prefer to live on their own and receive home support. Some people with ASD live completely independently. Supported living can work very well for some adults with ASD, because it means they can choose a place to live in the community, either alone or with other people, with the support they need. They may need 24-hour care, or they may only need help with important tasks for a couple of hours each week. The level of support an adult with ASD needs will be decided after your local authority's social services carry out an assessment, and it's agreed with the person and their carer. Read more about care assessments. ","URL":"/conditions/autistic-spectrum-disorder","Treatment and support":"With a proper diagnosis, adults with ASD may be able to access local autism support services, if available in their area. You can search for services for adults using the Autism Services Directory. The healthcare professionals who diagnose you with ASD should be able to provide more information and advice about the care and support services available to you. Read about assessing your care and support needs. Examples of programmes that may be available in your local area include: social learning programmes \u2013 to help you cope in social situations leisure activity programmes \u2013 these involve taking part in leisure activities, such as games, exercise, or going to the cinema or theatre with a group of people skills for daily living programmes \u2013 to help you if you have problems carrying out daily activities, such as eating and washing Adults with ASD may also benefit from some of the treatments offered to children with ASD, such as psychological therapy and medication. Read more about the help and support available for people with ASD. "},"Diagnosis":{"Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder ":"See your GP or health visitor if your child is showing symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or you're worried about their development. If appropriate, your GP can refer you to a healthcare professional or team who specialise in diagnosing ASD, or someone who has access to such a team. The specialist or specialist team will make a more in-depth assessment, which should be started within three months of the referral. If you're referred to an individual specialist, they may be a: psychologist \u2013 a healthcare professional with a psychology degree, plus further training and qualifications in psychology psychiatrist \u2013 a medically qualified doctor with further training in psychiatry paediatrician \u2013 a doctor who specialises in treating children speech and language therapist \u2013 a specialist in recognising and treating communication problems Some local health authorities use multidisciplinary teams. These are a combination of specialists who work together to make an assessment. A diagnosis of ASD is based on the range of features your child is showing. For most children: information will be needed from your GP, nursery or school staff, plus speech and language and occupational therapists, about your child's development, health and behaviour a speech and language therapist, and often an occupational therapist, will carry out an assessment a detailed physical examination will need to be carried out to rule out possible physical causes of your child's symptoms, such as an underlying condition like neurofibromatosis or Down's syndrome  the assessment will include a check for any coexisting physical health conditions and mental health problems In addition, for some children: you may be asked to attend a series of interviews so a detailed family history and the history of your child's development and behaviour can be drawn up your child may be asked to attend a series of appointments so specific skills and activities can be observed and assessed  Once this process is complete, a diagnosis of ASD may be confirmed. When a child is diagnosed with ASD, many parents are keen to find out as much as they can about the condition. The National Autistic Society has an excellent range of resources and advice. ","Diagnosing ASD in adults":"Some people with ASD grow up without their condition being recognised, but it's never too late to get a diagnosis. Some people may be scared of being diagnosed because they feel it will \"label\" them, and lower other people's expectations of them.  But there are several advantages to getting a diagnosis. It helps people with the condition and their families understand ASD and decide what sort of support they need. A diagnosis may also make it easier to access autism-specific services and claim benefits. See your GP if you think you may have ASD and ask them to refer you to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. The National Autistic Society website has information about being diagnosed with ASD if you're an adult. If you're already seeing a specialist for other reasons, you may want to ask them for a referral instead. Read more about diagnosing ASD in adults and advice for adults living with ASD.

Anxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood. Teenagers with an anxiety disorder are more likely to develop clinical depression, misuse drugs and feel suicidal. This is why you should get help as soon as you realise it's a problem. ","Introduction ":"It\u2019s normal for children to feel worried or anxious from time to time, such as when they\u2019re starting school or nursery, or moving to a new area. Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear \u2013 it's an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event. But for some children, anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis, interfering with their school, home and social life. This is when you may need professional help to tackle it before it becomes a more serious issue. So how do you know when your child's anxiety has reached this stage?

How common are anxiety disorders in children? Where can I go for further information and support? ","What types of anxiety do children and teenagers experience?":"Common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are described below. Children are commonly afraid of things like monsters, dogs or water. This is a perfectly normal part of growing up, but has the potential to become a phobia (a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects your child's day-to-day life. Read about phobias.  While it's normal for children to frequently have fears and worries, some anxious children may grow up to develop a long-term condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they become a teenager or young adult. Generalised anxiety disorder causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. People affected by it feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. Read more about generalised anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer. It is common in young children, and normally develops at about six months of age. It can make settling into nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult. Separation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they\u2019re feeling insecure about something \u2013 they could be reacting to changes at home, for example. Social anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or take part in activities. Social 'shyness' is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers, but it becomes a problem \u2013 'social anxiety disorder' \u2013 when everyday activities like shopping or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating. Social anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who have gone through puberty. Read more about social anxiety disorder. Some children become anxious about going to school, schoolwork, friendships or bullying, especially if they're changing school or moving up a level. They may not always share these worries with you, and instead complain of tummy aches or feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.  This may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life (see below). Post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults. It's rare for children to have panic attacks. ","When is anxiety a disorder that needs treating?":"It is probably time to get professional help for your child's anxiety if: you feel it is not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked you think it's slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships  it happens very frequently ","What are the signs of anxiety in children?":"Anxiety can make a child feel scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed. Some of the signs to look out for in your child are: finding it hard to concentrate not sleeping, or waking in the night with bad dreams not eating properly quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts constantly worrying or having negative thoughts feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often always crying being clingy all the time (when other children are ok) complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell Your child may not be old enough to recognise why they're feeling this way. The reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. Separation anxiety is common in younger children, whereas older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school performance, relationships or health.

Separation anxiety is the most common anxiety disorder in children younger than 12. ","Why are some children affected and others not?":"Some children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children. A child's anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they've inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger. Children can pick up anxious behaviour from being around anxious people. If you're worried that your child might be influenced by our own behaviour, you might want to listen to these podcasts offering advice about anxiety and worry and explaining how you can take control of your anxiety. Some children can also develop anxiety after a series of stressful events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are: Frequently moving house and school \u2013 it can be hard to settle when you're always expecting change Divorce or separation of parents, especially when there are new step parents and siblings (although many children will adapt to this and settle in time) Parents fighting or arguing Death of a close relative or friend Becoming seriously ill or injured in an accident Having someone in the family who is ill or disabled School-related issues such as homework or exams, or bullying or friendship problems Becoming involved in crime Being abused or neglected Children with certain conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders may experience anxiety as part of the symptoms of their condition, because of differences in the way their brain functions. ","How can an anxiety disorder be treated?":"The type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child's anxiety. It can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence about what is worrying them to a trained person, especially as it's someone they don't know. If your child is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they are at a youth counselling service, it will be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist. These sessions can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can work through the situation. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. It has been proven to help with anxiety that isn't severe, and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious. Your child will work with the therapist to find ways to change the way they think and find strategies for coping in situations that make them anxious. They'll usually have 9-20 sessions. It's not clear whether CBT is effective for children younger than six years of age. Learn more about CBT. If your child's anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication. A type of antidepressant, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things. Antidepressants usually take around two to four weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately. It's natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen. Read more about SSRIs.

Your child may be referred to the local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS), where the workers are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include psychologists, psychiatrists and psychotherapists. They should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child. Learn more about CAMHS. If your child doesn't want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service. Youth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what\u2019s worrying them, and get advice. For more information, visit Youth Access, the largest provider of young people's advice and counselling services in the UK.

"},"Title":"Anxiety disorders in children"},"Amblyopia (lazy eye)":{"Treatment":{" ":"A lazy eye (amblyopia) is often diagnosed and treated by an orthoptist under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. An orthoptist specialises in problems relating to vision development and eye movements. An ophthalmologist is a doctor who specialises in the treatment of eye conditions. The younger the child is when a lazy eye is diagnosed, the more successful treatment is likely to be. Treatment is unlikely to be successful if started after the age of eight. The two main treatment options for a lazy eye are: treating or correcting any underlying eye problems encouraging the use of the affected eye so vision can develop properly ","Eye drops":"Atropine eye drops can be used to blur the vision in the good eye. They expand (dilate) the pupil of the good eye and blur near vision, which encourages the use of the lazy eye. Side effects that can occur after using eye drops include: eye irritation reddening (flushing) of the skin headaches  However, these side effects are usually infrequent and rarely outweigh the benefits of using eye drops.  Eye drops can be as effective as using a patch, and often the choice of treatment is a matter of preference. Children who don't like having drops in their eyes can wear a patch, and vice versa. In some cases, a lazy eye doesn't improve despite proper treatment being received. However, sometimes poor results are down to a lack of compliance from either the parent or carer, or the child. It's very important that a suitable treatment is found that can be stuck to. If you're having trouble with one kind of treatment, you should discuss an alternative with your orthoptist. If surgery is recommended, more than one operation may be required to improve the appearance of a squint, and glasses may still need to be worn after surgery. A patch may also need to be worn, or eye drops used, if the lazy eye returns. Page last reviewed: 16/06/2016 Next review due: 31/05/2019 ","Using a patch":"Using a patch is known as occlusion. It involves placing a patch with a sticky rim over the \"good\" eye so the lazy eye is forced to work. It can be very effective in improving the sight in the lazy eye. The length of time the child will need to wear the patch will depend on how old they are, how serious the problem is, and how much they co-operate with wearing the patch. The orthoptist and ophthalmologist will determine how often follow-up checks are needed. Patches are most effective before a child reaches five years of age. Most children will need to wear the patch for a few hours a day for several weeks. While the patch is on, the child should do close-up activities, such as colouring, reading or schoolwork. Patches can be worn with glasses. Using a patch to treat a lazy eye can be a time-consuming process, and can sometimes be an unpleasant experience for the child. It's important to explain the reasons for using a patch, and the importance of sticking with the treatment, to your child so that they're motivated to do it. ","Surgery":"In children, most cataracts are removed to allow better development of vision in the affected eye. Cataract surgery for children is carried out under general anaesthetic. The procedure usually takes about one to two hours. Your child may be kept in hospital overnight to check their recovery process, and may have to use eye drops afterwards. Read more about treating cataracts in children. In some cases, surgery is used to improve the appearance of a squint. The operation will either strengthen or weaken the eye muscles of the lazy eye to change its position. This means the lazy eye will appear to be better aligned with the good eye. The child's vision won't improve, but their eyes will appear straighter and it will help the eyes work better together. Read more about treating squints. A droopy eyelid (ptosis) can also be corrected using surgery. A number of different treatment options can be used to encourage your child to use the affected eye. These are outlined below. ","Glasses":"Vision problems such as short- or long-sightedness can be corrected using glasses. These usually need to be worn constantly and checked regularly. Glasses may also help to straighten a squint, and in some cases can fix the lazy eye without the need for further treatment. Your child may say they can see better without their glasses. This is because their eyes have become used to working hard to focus and they now find it difficult to let the glasses focus for them. They'll need plenty of encouragement to wear their glasses continuously. Contact lenses are an alternative to glasses, but they may only be suitable for older children. Read more about treating short-sightedness and treating long-sightedness with corrective lenses. ","URL":"/conditions/Lazy-eye"},"Introduction":{" ":"A lazy eye (amblyopia) is a childhood condition where the vision in one eye doesn't develop properly.  This usually means that the child can see less clearly out of the affected eye and relies more on the \"good\" eye. An estimated 1 in 30 to 1 in 50 children will develop a lazy eye. The condition is usually diagnosed around the age of four. Lazy eye can sometimes affect both eyes, although this is rare. A lazy eye doesn't usually cause symptoms. Younger children are often unaware that there's anything wrong with their vision and, if they are, they're usually unable to explain what's wrong. Older children may complain that they can't see as well through one eye and have problems with reading, writing and drawing. In some cases, you may notice that one eye looks different from the other. However, this is usually a sign of another condition that could lead to a lazy eye, such as: a squint \u2013 where the weaker eye looks inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards, while the other eye looks forwards refractive errors \u2013 where a person is either short-sighted (myopia) or long-sighted (hyperopia) childhood cataracts \u2013 cloudy patches that develop in the lens, which is located behind the clear layer of tissue at the front of the eye (cornea)  One way to check your child's eyes is to cover each eye with your hand, one at a time. They might object to covering the good eye, but they might not mind if you cover the lazy eye. If they try to push your hand away from one eye but not the other, it may be a sign they can see better out of one eye. Lazy eye is often diagnosed during routine eye tests before parents realise there's a problem.  Children should have their eyes tested once they're old enough to attend a sight test, which is usually after they are 3.5 years old. It's difficult to treat lazy eye after the age of 4.5, so it's a good idea for children to have an eye test between the ages of 3.5 and 4.5. However, visit your GP if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight. If necessary, they can refer your child to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for further testing. Read more about diagnosing a lazy eye. The eyes work like a camera. Light passes through the lens of each eye and reaches a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. The retina translates the image into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. The brain combines the signals from each eye into a three-dimensional image. A lazy eye occurs when the brain connections responsible for vision aren't made properly. This can be the result of: a reduction in the amount of light entering the eye a lack of focus in the eye confusion between the eyes \u2013 where the two images aren't the same (such as a squint) Left untreated, this can lead to the eye's central vision never reaching normal levels. Read more about the causes of a lazy eye. In most cases it is possible to treat a lazy eye, usually in two stages. The underlying problem is first corrected using glasses to correct the focus of the eye, which often helps to correct a squint as well. The child is then encouraged to use the affected eye again. This can be done using an eye patch to cover the stronger eye, or eye drops to temporarily impair the vision in the stronger eye. Treatment is often effective, but it's a gradual process that takes many months to work. Read more about treating a lazy eye. Page last reviewed: 16/06/2016 Next review due: 31/05/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Lazy-eye"},"Causes":{" ":"A lazy eye (amblyopia) is caused when something disrupts the normal development of vision. It's often assumed that younger children have the same vision as adults, but this isn't the case. Children have to learn how to see \u2013 more specifically, their brains have to learn how to interpret the nerve signals sent from the eyes to the brain. It usually takes around three to five years before children can see as clearly as adults, and up to seven years before the eyes become fully developed. If something affects one of the eyes as it develops, the signals become disrupted, which affects the quality of the images interpreted by the brain. The brain starts to ignore the poor-quality images and becomes increasingly reliant on the stronger eye. Common conditions that disrupt the development of vision and can cause lazy eye are discussed below. ","Squint":"A squint is a common eye condition that affects around 1 in 20 children. If a child has a squint, one eye looks straight ahead but the other eye looks off to the left, right, up or down. This causes the brain to receive two very different images that it can't combine. In adults, this would result in double vision. In children who are still developing, it causes the brain to ignore images from the squinting eye, leading to a lazy eye. Some babies are born with squints. Older children can develop a squint as a result of a group of eye conditions called refractive errors. ","Refractive errors":"Refractive errors are caused when the light rays entering the eye aren't properly focused. This is caused by problems with the structure of the eye. Two examples of refractive errors that could lead to a lazy eye are: long-sightedness \u2013 where distant objects appear normal but nearby objects are blurred astigmatism \u2013 where an irregular-shaped cornea or lens leads to blurred or distorted vision Refractive errors can cause the brain to rely on the signals from one eye, meaning the other eye fails to develop properly. Less common conditions that can cause a lazy eye include: an eye disease such as a sore on the transparent layer at the front of the eye (corneal ulcer) or a scar childhood cataracts \u2013 clouding of the lens of the eye that's present from birth a droopy eyelid (ptosis) Page last reviewed: 16/06/2016 Next review due: 31/05/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Lazy-eye"},"Title":"Lazy eye (amblyopia)","Diagnosis":{" ":"A lazy eye (amblyopia) ideally needs to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible, preferably before a child is five years of age. However, it can often be difficult to know whether a child has a lazy eye as they might not realise anything is wrong with their vision. This means a lazy eye may not be diagnosed until a child has their first eye test. If an optometrist (a healthcare professional specialising in eyes) suspects a lazy eye, they'll also test for other conditions, such as long-sightedness (hyperopia) and a squint. Visit your GP or tell your health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight at any stage. Your baby's eyes will be examined within 72 hours of birth. This simple examination is used to check for obvious physical defects. Your baby will have a second eye examination when they're between six and eight weeks old. A child's vision should develop in the following way over the first year of life: 6 weeks old \u2013 follows a bright or interesting object, such as a face, with their eyes 2-3 months old \u2013 starts to reach for things they see 3-5 months old \u2013 starts to mimic facial expressions and look at objects more closely 6-12 months old \u2013 focuses on objects that are both near and far away, sees simple shapes, scribbles with a crayon, and is interested in pictures Shortly before or after having a baby, all new parents are given a Personal Child Health Record (PCHR), which highlights developmental milestones for vision. When your child is around one or two years old, you may be asked whether you have any concerns about their eyesight during a review of their health and development.  If necessary, specific eye tests that check for vision problems can be arranged. Your child's vision may also be tested before they start school when they're around four or five years old, but this varies depending on where you live.

","Potential health risks":"Serotonin syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially serious, set of side effects linked to SSRIs and SNRIs. Serotonin syndrome occurs when the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain become too high. It's usually triggered when you take an SSRI or SNRI in combination with another medication (or substance) that also raises serotonin levels, such as another antidepressant or St John\u2019s Wort. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome can include: confusion agitation muscle twitching sweating shivering diarrhoea If you experience the symptoms listed above, you should stop taking the medication and seek immediate advice from your GP or specialist. If this isn't possible, call NHS 111. Symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome include: a very high temperature (fever) seizures (fits) irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) unconsciousness If you experience symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome, seek emergency medical help immediately by dialling 999 to ask for an ambulance. Elderly people who take antidepressants, particularly those who take SSRIs, may experience a severe fall in sodium (salt) levels, known as hyponatraemia. This may lead to a build-up of fluid inside the cells of the body, which can be potentially dangerous. This can happen because SSRIs can block the effects of a hormone that regulates levels of sodium and fluid in the body. Elderly people are vulnerable because fluid levels become more difficult for the body to regulate as people age. Mild hyponatraemia can cause symptoms similar to depression or side effects of antidepressants, such as: feeling sick headache muscle pain reduced appetite confusion More severe hyponatraemia can cause the following symptoms: feeling listless and tired disorientation agitation psychosis seizures (fits) The most serious cases of hyponatraemia can cause you to stop breathing or enter a coma. If you suspect mild hyponatraemia, you should call your GP for advice and stop taking SSRIs for the time being. If you suspect severe hyponatraemia, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Hyponatraemia can be treated by feeding a sodium solution into the body through an intravenous drip. Long-term use of SSRIs and TCAs has been linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, although it's not clear if the use of these antidepressants causes diabetes to develop directly. It may be that the weight gain some people using antidepressants experience increases the risk of them developing type 2 diabetes. For more information, see \"Claim that antidepressants cause diabetes unproven\". In rare cases, some people experience suicidal thoughts and a desire to self-harm when they first take antidepressants. Young people under 25 seem particularly at risk. Contact your GP, or go to hospital immediately, if you have thoughts of killing or harming yourself at any time while taking antidepressants. It may be useful to tell a relative or close friend if you've started taking antidepressants and ask them to read the leaflet that comes with your medication. You should then ask them to tell you if they think your symptoms are getting worse, or if they're worried about changes in your behaviour.

","URL":"/conditions/Antidepressant-drugs","Side effects of antidepressants ":"The side effects of antidepressants can cause problems at first, but then generally improve with time. It's important to continue treatment, even if you're affected by side effects, as it will take several weeks before you begin to benefit from treatment. With time, you should find that the benefits of treatment outweigh any problems from side effects. During the first few months of treatment, you'll usually see your doctor or a specialist nurse at least once every two to four weeks to see how well the medication is working. Some of the more common side effects of the main types of antidepressants are outlined below. For more information about your specific medication, see the patient information leaflet that comes with it. "},"Uses":{"Bedwetting in children":"TCAs are sometimes used to treat bedwetting in children, as they can help relax the muscles of the bladder. This increases bladder capacity and reduces the urge to urinate. Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","Children and young people":"Children and young people with moderate to severe depression should first be offered a course of psychotherapy that lasts for at least three months. In some cases, an SSRI called fluoxetine may be offered in combination with psychotherapy to treat moderate to severe depression in young people aged 12-18. ","Long-term pain":"Even though a type of antidepressant called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) weren't originally designed to be painkillers, there's evidence to suggest they're effective in treating chronic (long-term) nerve pain in some people. Chronic nerve pain, also known as neuropathic pain, is caused by nerve damage or other problems with the nerves, and is often unresponsive to traditional painkillers, such as paracetamol. Amitriptyline is a TCA that's usually used to treat neuropathic pain. Conditions that may benefit from treatment with amitriptyline include: complex regional pain syndrome peripheral neuropathy multiple sclerosis (MS) conditions where a nerve becomes trapped, such as sciatica Antidepressants have also been used to treat cases of chronic pain that don't involve nerves (non-neuropathic pain). However, they're thought to be less effective for this purpose. As well as TCAs, SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can also be used to treat chronic non-neuropathic pain. Conditions that cause non-neuropathic pain which may benefit from treatment with antidepressants include fibromyalgia, chronic back pain and chronic neck pain. ","When antidepressants are used ":"The main use for antidepressants is treating clinical depression in adults. They're also used for other mental health conditions and treatment of long-term pain. In most cases, adults with moderate to severe depression are given antidepressants as a first form of treatment. They're often prescribed along with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of therapy that uses a problem-solving approach to help improve thought, mood and behaviour. Antidepressants aren't always recommended for treating mild depression because research has found limited effectiveness. However, antidepressants are sometimes prescribed for a few months for mild depression to see if you experience any improvement in your symptoms. If you don\u2019t see any benefits in this time, the medication will be slowly withdrawn. Initially, a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is usually prescribed. If your symptoms haven't improved after about four weeks, an alternative antidepressant may be recommended or your dose may be increased. Many antidepressants can be prescribed by your GP, but some types can only be used under the supervision of a mental health professional. If the depression doesn't respond to antidepressant medication alone, other treatments, such as CBT, may also be used to help achieve better results. They may also give higher doses of the medication. ","URL":"/conditions/Antidepressant-drugs","Other mental health conditions":"Antidepressants can also be used to help treat other mental health conditions, including: anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) panic disorder serious phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia bulimia post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) As with depression, SSRIs are usually the first choice of treatment for these conditions. If SSRIs prove ineffective, an alternative type of antidepressant can be used. "},"Introduction":{"Yellow Card Scheme":"The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information. Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","Side effects":"Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Always check the information leaflet that comes with your medication to see what the possible side effects are. In general, the most common side effects of antidepressants are usually mild. Side effects should improve within a few days or weeks of treatment, as the body gets used to the medication. Read more information about: possible side effects of antidepressants cautions and interactions of antidepressants ","Introduction ":"Antidepressants are a type of medication used to treat clinical depression or prevent it recurring. They can also be used to treat a number of other conditions, including: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) generalised anxiety disorder  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  Antidepressants are also sometimes used to treat people with long-term (chronic) pain. Read more about when antidepressants are used. ","Doses and duration of treatment":"Antidepressants are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. Antidepressants usually need to be taken for around seven days (without missing a dose) before the benefit is felt. It's important not to stop taking them if you get some mild side effects early on, as these effects usually wear off quickly. If you take an antidepressant for four weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative medication. A course of treatment usually lasts for six months, although a two-year course may be recommended for people with a previous history of depression. Some people with recurrent depression may be advised to take them indefinitely. Read more about antidepressant doses. ","How antidepressants work":"It's thought that antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, can improve mood and emotion, although this process isn't fully understood. Increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain. While antidepressants can treat the symptoms of depression, they don't always address its causes. This is why they're usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions caused by emotional distress. ","Alternatives to antidepressants":"Alternative treatments for depression include talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Increasingly, people with moderate to severe depression are treated using a combination of antidepressants and CBT. Antidepressants work quickly in reducing symptoms, whereas CBT takes time to deal with causes of depression and ways of overcoming it. Regular exercise has also been shown to be useful for those with mild depression. Read more about alternatives to antidepressants. ","Different types of antidepressants":"There are different types of antidepressants. Some of the most widely used types are discussed below. SSRIs are the most widely prescribed type of antidepressants. They're usually preferred over other antidepressants, as they cause fewer side effects. An overdose is also less likely to be serious. Fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI (sold under the brand name Prozac). Other SSRIs include citalopram (Cipramil), paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Lustral). SNRIs are similar to SSRIs. They were designed to be a more effective antidepressant than SSRIs. However, the evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating depression is uncertain. It seems that some people respond better to SSRIs, while others respond better to SNRIs. Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta and Yentreve) and venlafaxine (Efexor). NASSAs may be effective for some people who are unable to take SSRIs. The side effects of NASSAs are similar to those of SSRIs, but they're thought to cause fewer sexual problems. However, they may also cause more drowsiness at first. The main NASSA prescribed in the UK is mirtazapine (Zispin). TCAs are an older type of antidepressant. They're no longer usually recommended as a first-line treatment for depression because they can be more dangerous if an overdose is taken. They also cause more unpleasant side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs. Exceptions are sometimes made for people with severe depression that fail to respond to other treatments. TCAs may also be recommended for other mental health conditions, such as OCD and bipolar disorder. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline (Tryptizol), clomipramine (Anafranil), imipramine (Tofranil), lofepramine (Gamanil) and nortriptyline (Allegron). Some types of TCAs, such as amitriptyline, can also be used to treat chronic nerve pain. ","How effective are antidepressants?":"Most people benefit from taking antidepressants to some degree, but research suggests antidepressants may not be as effective as previously thought in cases of mild depression. However, they're the most effective treatment in relieving symptoms quickly, particularly in cases of severe depression. The Royal College of Psychiatrists estimates that 50-65% of people treated with an antidepressant for depression will see an improvement, compared to 25-30% of those taking inactive \"dummy\" pills (placebo). This means that most people do benefit from antidepressants, even if it's sometimes a result of the placebo effect. ","URL":"/conditions/Antidepressant-drugs"},"Title":"Antidepressants","Dosage":{"About your antidepressant dose ":"When prescribing antidepressants, your GP usually selects the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of side effects. If this dose doesn't work, it can be gradually increased. Antidepressants are usually taken in tablet form. Depending on the type of antidepressant prescribed and the severity of your depression, you'll usually have to take one to three tablets a day. It usually takes around seven days before you begin to notice the effects of antidepressants. Contact your doctor if you haven't noticed any improvement after four weeks, as they may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. It's usually recommended that a course of antidepressants lasts at least six months, to prevent your condition recurring when you stop. However, if you've experienced previous episodes of depression, a two-year course may be recommended and some people with recurrent illness are advised to carry on taking medication indefinitely. The recommended course of treatment largely depends on weighing up the benefits of the medication against the side effects. If your illness is severe and the medication is effective, treatment will often be continued. If your illness is mild and the medication doesn\u2019t help and causes side effects, continued treatment won't be recommended. It's important not to miss any of your doses, as this could make your treatment less effective. If you do miss one of your doses, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time to take your next dose. In this case, you should just skip the missed dose. Don't take a double dose to \"make up\" for the one you missed. If you take more tablets than prescribed, contact your GP as soon as possible for advice. If this isn't possible, contact your local out of hours service, or call NHS 111. Taking a double dose is unlikely to be harmful, but you should only do so if advised by a medical professional. You shouldn't suddenly stop taking antidepressants, even if you feel better. Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms, such as: stomach upsets flu-like symptoms anxiety dizziness sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks seizures (fits) Coming off antidepressants too soon can cause your condition to return, and stopping before you have been taking them for three to four weeks may mean the medication hasn't had a chance to take effect. If your GP or mental health specialist decides to stop your course of antidepressants, they'll reduce the dose gradually over a few weeks. Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Antidepressant-drugs"},"Alternatives":{"Exercise":"Research suggests that regular exercise may be a more effective treatment for mild depression than antidepressants. Exercise helps boost levels of chemicals called serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which can lift your mood. Exercising on a regular basis can boost self-esteem and confidence, which can help to relieve symptoms of depression. Your GP may refer you to a qualified fitness trainer for an exercise scheme, or you can read about starting exercise. Read more about exercise for depression. ","Electric shock treatment":"Sometimes a treatment called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended if you have severe depression and other treatments haven't worked, as it can be highly effective. During ECT, you'll first be given an anaesthetic and medication to relax your muscles. Then you'll receive an electric current to your brain through electrodes placed on your head. You may be given a series of ECT sessions. It's usually given twice a week for three to six weeks. It's not exactly clear how ECT works, but recent studies suggest it may help reduce connections in an area of the brain linked to depression. For most people, ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effect tends to wear off after several months. Some people get unpleasant side effects, including short-term headaches, memory problems, nausea and muscle aches. However, these risks need to be balanced against the risks of other treatments and the effects of not treating depression.

You can either talk to a friend or relative, or you can ask your GP to suggest a local self-help group. There are also chat rooms on the internet that offer support. Read more about depression support groups. ","Lithium":"If you've tried several different antidepressants and seen no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium, in addition to your current treatment. There are two types of lithium \u2013 lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you're taking one that works for you, it's best not to change. If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. So, you'll need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you're taking it. You'll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet. Side effects of lithium include: dry mouth a metallic taste in your mouth some mild shaking of your hands diarrhoea These side effects usually pass with time once your body gets used to the medication. ","Talking therapies":"Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy that's increasingly being used in the treatment of depression. Most experts recommend that people with moderate to severe depression are treated with a combination of CBT and antidepressants. However, if you're unable or unwilling to take antidepressants, you have the option of receiving CBT on its own. CBT helps you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. It helps you recognise that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It also teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts. CBT is usually available on the NHS, although the waiting lists are usually long. You normally have a short course of sessions, usually six to eight sessions, over 10-12 weeks, on a one-to-one basis, with a therapist trained in CBT. In some cases, you may be offered group CBT. Computerised CBT is a form of CBT that works through a computer screen, rather than face-to-face with a therapist. These therapies can be prescribed by your GP or a mental health specialist and are carried out with their advice and support. Ask your GP for more information or read more about self-help therapies. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with other people and on problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. A course of IPT is usually structured in the same way as a course of CBT. There's some evidence that IPT can be as effective as antidepressants or CBT, but more research is needed. Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you're experiencing in your life to find new ways of dealing with them. Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems, but don't tell you what to do. Counselling on the NHS usually consists of 6-12 sessions lasting an hour each. You talk in confidence to a counsellor, who supports you and offers practical advice. Counselling is ideal for people who are healthy but need help coping with a current crisis, such as anger, relationship issues, bereavement, redundancy, infertility or the onset of a serious illness.

However, exceptions can be made if the risks posed by depression (or other mental health conditions) outweigh any potential risks of treatment. Potential complications that have been linked to antidepressant use during pregnancy include: loss of the pregnancy birth defects affecting the baby\u2019s heart (congenital heart disease) a rare condition in newborns called pulmonary hypertension, where the blood pressure inside the lungs is abnormally high, causing breathing difficulties However, there's no hard evidence that antidepressants cause these complications. If you're pregnant and depressed, you should discuss the pros and cons of antidepressants with the doctor in charge of your care. If antidepressants are recommended, they will usually be a type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as fluoxetine. ","Cautions for specific antidepressants":"SSRIs may not be suitable if you have: bipolar disorder and you're in a manic phase (a period where you're extremely excitable), although they can be useful for depressive phases a bleeding disorder, or if you're taking medicines that make it more likely you may bleed (such as warfarin) type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes epilepsy \u2013 SSRIs should only be taken if your epilepsy is well controlled, and the medication should be stopped if your epilepsy gets worse kidney disease SNRIs may not be suitable if you have a history of heart disease or you have poorly controlled high blood pressure. TCAs may not be suitable if you have: a history of heart disease recently had a heart attack liver disease an inherited blood disorder called porphyria bipolar disorder schizophrenia a growth on your adrenal glands that is causing high blood pressure (pheochromocytoma) an enlarged prostate gland  narrow angle glaucoma \u2013 increased pressure in the eye epilepsy Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","Interactions with other medications":"Antidepressants can react unpredictably with other medications, including over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication to see if there are any medications you should avoid. If in doubt, your pharmacist or GP should be able to advise you. ","Driving and operating machinery":"Some antidepressants can cause dizziness, drowsiness and blurred vision, particularly when you first start taking them. If you do experience these problems, you should avoid driving or using tools and machinery. ","Children and young people":"The use of antidepressants isn't usually recommended in children and young people under the age of 18. This is because there's evidence that, in rare cases, they can trigger thoughts about suicide and acts of self-harm in this age group. Concerns have also been raised that their use could affect the development of the brain in children and young people. An exception can usually only be made if the following points are met: the person being treated has failed to respond to talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and the person being treated will continue to receive talking therapies in combination with antidepressants, and the treatment is supervised by a psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) If an antidepressant is recommended, then fluoxetine is usually the first choice. ","Illegal drugs":"The use of illegal drugs isn't recommended if you're taking antidepressants, particularly if you've been prescribed a TCA. This is because they can cause unpredictable and unpleasant effects. In particular, you should avoid taking: cannabis \u2013 smoking cannabis while taking a TCA can make you feel very ill amphetamines (speed) cocaine heroin ketamine As with alcohol, illegal drugs can make symptoms of depression or other mental health conditions worse. ","Alcohol":"You should be wary of drinking alcohol if you're taking antidepressants, as alcohol is itself a depressant and drinking alcohol can make your symptoms worse. If you drink alcohol while taking types of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), you may become drowsy and dizzy. You're less likely to experience unpleasant or unpredictable effects if you drink alcohol while taking an SSRI or a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant, but avoiding alcohol is often still recommended in these cases. ","Other antidepressants":"You should never take two different types of antidepressants, such as an SSRI and a TCA, unless advised by the doctor in charge of your care. This is because taking certain combinations of antidepressants can make you feel very ill and can be life-threatening. If a decision is taken to switch you from one type to another, the dosage of the first antidepressant will usually be gradually reduced before the second is administered. ","Cautions and interactions ":"There are several important things to consider when taking antidepressants. You should discuss these with your GP or mental health professional. ","Breastfeeding":"As a precaution, the use of antidepressants if you're breastfeeding isn't usually recommended. However, there are circumstances when both the benefits of treatment for depression (or other mental health conditions) and the benefits of breastfeeding your baby outweigh the potential risks. If you're treated with antidepressants when breastfeeding, then paroxetine or sertraline is normally recommended. ","St John\u2019s Wort":"St John\u2019s Wort is a popular herbal remedy promoted for the treatment of depression. While there's evidence of its effectiveness, many experts advise against its use, because the amount of active ingredient varies among individual brands and batches, making the effects unpredictable. Taking St John's Wort with other medications, such as anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, can also cause serious health problems. You shouldn't take St John's Wort if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, as it's unclear whether it's safe.

Most women have a period every 28 days or so, but it's common to have a slightly shorter or longer cycle than this (from 24 to 35 days). Some women don't always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time. Read more about irregular periods and heavy periods. This page covers: Why your periods might stop When to see your GP There are a number of reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are: pregnancy  stress  sudden weight loss  being overweight or obese extreme overexercising  taking the contraceptive pill reaching the menopause  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a long-term medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature ovarian failure. ","Pregnancy":"You might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails. It might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it doesn't arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant. It's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress. ","Sudden weight loss":"Excessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, where you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. The dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely. If your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, you'll be referred to a psychiatrist. ","Referral to a specialist":"If your GP thinks an underlying medical condition might have caused your periods to stop, they may refer you to a specialist. Depending on what your GP suspects is causing the problem, you may be referred to: a gynaecologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the female reproductive system an endocrinologist \u2013 a specialist in treating hormonal conditions You may have a full gynaecological examination and various tests, including: blood tests \u2013 to see whether you have abnormal levels of certain hormones, such as prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinising hormone an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan \u2013 to identify any problems with your reproductive system or the pituitary gland in your brain  ","Being overweight or obese":"Being overweight or obese can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women. The excess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight or obese, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely. ","Treating underlying conditions":"If test results indicate an underlying medical condition has caused your periods to stop, you may be offered treatment for your condition. For example, if the cause is PCOS, you may be advised to take the contraceptive pill or tablets containing a hormone called progesterone. Read more about the treatment of PCOS. If the cause is early menopause (premature ovarian failure), this means the ovaries no longer function normally. Hormone medication is usually recommended. Treatments to try include the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Read about Johanna's experience of premature ovarian failure. If you have an overactive thyroid gland, you may be given medication to stop your thyroid gland producing too many hormones.  Read more about treating an overactive thyroid gland. Page last reviewed: 28/07/2016 Next review due: 28/07/2019 ","Menopause":"You may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels will start to decrease, and ovulation will become less regular. After the menopause, your periods will stop completely. The menopause is a natural part of the ageing process in women, which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure. ","Contraceptive pill":"You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This isn't usually a cause for concern. Some types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill, contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether. However, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception. ","URL":"/conditions/Periods-absent","Stress":"If you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful. Try to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help. If you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act. ","Extreme overexercising":"The stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating. You'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop. If you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods. ","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)":"Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation doesn't take place. PCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK. The condition is responsible for as many as one in three cases of stopped periods. See your GP if you're not pregnant \u2013 you've had a negative pregnancy test \u2013 and you've missed more than three periods in a row. If you're sexually active and you haven't taken a pregnancy test, your GP may advise you to take one. They may also ask you about: your medical history your family's medical history your sexual history any emotional issues you're having any recent changes in your body weight the amount of exercise you do Your GP may recommend waiting to see whether your periods return on their own. In some cases you may need treatment for your periods to return. You should also see your GP if your periods stop before you're 45 or you're still bleeding when you're over 55. "},"Title":"Stopped or missed periods"},"Peak flow test":{"Introduction":{" ":"Peak flow is a simple measurement of how quickly you can blow air out of your lungs. It's often used to help diagnose and monitor asthma. A peak flow test involves blowing as hard as you can into a small, hand-held device called a peak flow meter. These are available on prescription or can be bought from most pharmacies. This page covers: Why peak flow is measured How to measure your peak flow Your peak flow score What to do if you peak flow is low By measuring how fast you're able to breathe out, your peak flow score can indicate whether your airways are narrowed. This could be a sign that you have asthma, although other tests such as spirometry will often be needed to confirm the diagnosis. If you've already been diagnosed with asthma, measuring your peak flow regularly can be a useful way of monitoring your condition. Your score can show whether or not your condition is getting worse. It can also check if your medication is working, and indicate whether you're having an asthma attack. Measuring your peak flow before and after exposure to a possible asthma trigger, such as something you're allergic to or a substance you're exposed to at work, may also show if anything in particular causes your symptoms. The first time your peak flow is measured, you'll be taught how to do it by a doctor or nurse. Thereafter, they may advise you to carry out the test regularly at home using your own peak flow meter. To measure your peak flow: find a comfortable position, either sitting or standing ensure the meter is set to \"0\", your fingers are not obstructing the measurement scale, and the meter is held horizontally breathe in as deeply as you can and place your lips tightly around the mouthpiece breathe out as quickly and as hard as you can when you've finished breathing out, make a note of your reading This should be repeated three times, and the highest of the three measurements should be recorded as your peak flow score. If you're monitoring your asthma at home, you may have a diary or chart to record your score. You can download a peak flow diary (PDF, 2.2Mb) from the Asthma UK website if you don't have one. Your peak flow score \u2013 also known as your peak expiratory flow (PEF) \u2013 will be displayed on the side of your peak flow meter. This is given in litres of air breathed out per minute (l/min). What's considered a normal score depends on your age, height and gender. To help diagnose asthma, your result can be compared to what would usually be expected for someone of your age, height and gender. A significant difference between your score and a normal score, or a difference in your scores in the morning and evening or when your symptoms are good and bad, may suggest you have asthma. If you're monitoring your asthma at home, your score should be compared to your best result at a point when your condition was well controlled. A big difference between your current and best score could be a sign that your condition is becoming poorly controlled or that you're having an asthma attack. If you have a personal asthma action plan, it might say what you should do when your peak flow score falls to a certain level. You may just need to use one of your inhalers, or you may need to seek medical help. See treating asthma and what to do if you have an asthma attack for more information. Speak to your GP or asthma nurse if you've been diagnosed with asthma and don't have a personal action plan, or if you're concerned about your peak flow score and don't know what to do. You can download a personal action plan (PDF, 681kb) that you can fill in with your doctor or nurse from the Asthma UK website.

They come as a liquid or chewable tablets and can be bought from pharmacies and shops without a prescription. This page covers: When they're used Common types How and when to take them Taking them with food, alcohol and other medicines Side effects Who may not be able to take them Antacids may help if you have: indigestion heartburn or acid reflux \u2013 also known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) a stomach ulcer gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)  They can quickly relieve your symptoms for a few hours. But they don't treat the underlying cause and long-term use isn't recommended. Speak to your GP if you find you need to take antacids regularly. Many different types of antacid are available. Some are sold under a brand name and others are named after their main ingredient. Ingredients to look for include: aluminium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesium trisilicate magnesium hydroxide calcium carbonate sodium bicarbonate Some antacids also contain other medicines, such as an alginate (which coats your gullet with a protective layer) and simeticone (which reduces flatulence). Check the instructions on the packet or leaflet to see how much antacid to take and how often. This depends on the exact medicine you're taking. Antacids should be used when you have symptoms or think you will get them soon \u2013 for most people, the best time to take them is with or soon after meals, and just before going to bed. Remember that doses for children may be lower than for adults. Contact your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111, if you take too much of the medicine and start to feel unwell. It's best to take antacids with food or soon after eating because this is when you're most likely to get indigestion or heartburn. The effect of the medicine may also last longer if taken with food. Antacids can affect how well other medicines work, so don't take other medicines within two to four hours of taking an antacid. You can drink alcohol while taking antacids, but alcohol can irritate your stomach and make your symptoms worse. Antacids don't usually have many side effects if they're only taken occasionally and at the recommended dose. But sometimes they can cause: diarrhoea or constipation flatulence (wind) stomach cramps feeling sick or vomiting These should pass once you stop taking the medicine. Speak to a pharmacist or your GP if they don't improve or are troublesome. You may need to switch to another medicine. Antacids are safe for most people to take, although they aren't suitable for everyone. Speak to a pharmacist or your GP for advice first if you: are pregnant or breastfeeding \u2013 most antacids are considered safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding, but always get advice first are looking for a medicine for a child under 12 years of age \u2013 some antacids are not recommended for children have liver disease, kidney disease or heart failure \u2013 some antacids may not be safe if you have one of these problems have an illness that means you need to control how much salt (sodium) is in your diet, such as high blood pressure or cirrhosis (liver scarring) \u2013 some antacids contain high levels of sodium, which could make you unwell are taking other medicines \u2013 antacids can interfere with other medications and may need be avoided or taken at a different time Page last reviewed: 14/11/2016 Next review due: 14/11/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/antacid-medicines"},"Title":"Antacids"},"Brain abscess":{"Treatment":{"Treating a brain abscess ":"Treatment for a brain abscess usually involves a combination of medication and surgery, depending on the size and number of brain abscesses. A brain abscess is a medical emergency, so you'll need treatment in hospital until your condition is stable. Treatment with medication often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed to reduce the risk of complications. In some cases, it may be possible to treat an abscess with medication alone, or surgery may be too risky. Medication is recommended over surgery if you have: several abscesses a small abscess (less than 2cm) an abscess deep inside the brain meningitis (an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain) as well as an abscess hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain) You'll normally be given antibiotics or antifungal medication through a drip, directly into a vein. Doctors will aim to treat the abscess and the original infection that caused it. If the abscess is larger than 2cm, it's usually necessary to drain the pus out of the abscess. However, you'll still need a course of antibiotics after surgery. There are two surgical techniques for treating a brain abscess: simple aspiration craniotomy Simple aspiration involves using a CT scan to locate the abscess, then drilling a small hole known as a \"burr hole\" into the skull. The pus is drained and the hole is sealed. A simple aspiration takes around one hour to complete. Open aspiration and excisions are usually carried out using a surgical procedure known as a craniotomy. ","Craniotomy":"A craniotomy may be recommended if an abscess doesn't respond to aspiration or reoccurs at a later date. During a craniotomy, the surgeon shaves a small section of your hair and removes a small piece of your skull bone (a bone flap) to gain access to your brain. The abscess is then drained of pus or totally removed. CT-guidance may be used during the operation, to allow the surgeon to more accurately locate the exact position of the abscess. Once the abscess has been treated, the bone is replaced. The operation usually takes around three hours, which includes recovery from general anaesthetic, where you're put to sleep. As with all surgery, a craniotomy carries risks, but serious complications are uncommon. Possible complications of a craniotomy may include:  swelling and bruising around your face \u2013 which is common after a craniotomy and should lessen after the operation headaches \u2013 these are common after a craniotomy and may last several months, but should eventually settle down a blood clot in the brain \u2013 further surgery may be required to remove it stiff jaw \u2013 the surgeon may need to make a small cut to a muscle that helps with chewing, which will heal but can become stiff for a few months; exercising the muscle by regularly chewing sugar-free gum should help relieve the stiffness movement of the bone flap \u2013 the bone flap in your skull may feel like it moves and you may experience a clicking sensation; this can feel strange, but it's not dangerous and will stop as the skull heals The site of the cut (incision) in your skull can become infected, although this is uncommon. You're usually given antibiotics around the time of your operation to prevent infection. Once your brain abscess has been treated, you'll probably stay in hospital for several weeks so your body can be supported while you recover. You'll also receive a number of CT scans, to make sure the brain abscess has been completely removed. Most people need a further six to 12 weeks rest at home before they're fit enough to return to work or full-time education. After treatment for a brain abscess, avoid any contact sport where there's a risk of injury to the skull, such as boxing, rugby or football. ","Advice for drivers":"If you've had brain surgery and you hold a driving licence, you're legally required to inform the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). It's likely that the DVLA will suspend your driving licence due to your increased risk of having an epileptic fit. Your licence will only be returned once your GP or surgeon confirms it's safe for you to drive. For most people, this is likely to be 12 months after surgery with no seizures occurring.

It usually occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the brain tissue after an infection or severe head injury. Although the risk of developing a brain abscess is extremely low in England, it is a life-threatening condition and should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  The symptoms of a brain abscess may develop quickly or slowly but can include: headache \u2013 which is often severe, located in a single section of the head and can't be relieved with painkillers changes in mental state \u2013 such as confusion or irritability problems with nerve function \u2013 such as muscle weakness, slurred speech or paralysis on one side of the body a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above  seizures (fits) nausea and vomiting stiff neck changes in vision \u2013 such as blurring, greying of vision or double vision (due to the abscess putting pressure on the optic nerve) Any symptoms that suggest a problem with the brain and nervous system should be treated as a medical emergency. These include: slurred speech muscle weakness or paralysis seizures occurring in a person with no previous history of seizures If you or someone you know experiences any of these symptoms, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Any symptoms that suggest a worsening infection, such as fever and vomiting, should be reported to your GP immediately. If your GP isn't available, contact your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111. There are three main ways a brain abscess can develop. These are: an infection in another part of the skull \u2013 such as an ear infection, sinusitis or dental abscess, which can spread directly into the brain an infection in another part of the body \u2013 for example, the infection that causes pneumonia spreading into the brain via the blood trauma, such as a severe head injury \u2013 that cracks open the skull, allowing bacteria or fungi to enter the brain However, in some cases, the source of the infection remains unknown. Read more about the causes of a brain abscess. If a brain abscess is suspected, an initial assessment will be made based on your symptoms, medical history and whether you've had a recent infection or a weakened immune system. Blood tests can also be carried out to check for an infection. If you're referred to hospital for further tests, you may have either: a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a series of X-rays are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body. If an abscess is found, a procedure known as CT-guided aspiration may be used to remove a sample of pus for testing. This involves using a CT scan to guide a needle to the site of the abscess. A brain abscess is regarded as a medical emergency. Swelling caused by the abscess can disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. There's also a risk of the abscess bursting (rupturing). If left untreated, a brain abscess can cause permanent brain damage and could be fatal. A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of: medication \u2013 either antibiotics or antifungals surgery \u2013 either draining the pus through a hole in the skull (simple aspiration) or opening the skull and removing the abscess entirely (craniotomy) Treatment with antibiotics often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed, to reduce the risk of complications. Read more about treating a brain abscess. Complications of a brain abscess can include: a reoccurring abscess \u2013 seek immediate medical advice if you think there's even a small chance your abscess has reoccurred; this is more common in people with a weakened immune system or cyanotic heart disease brain damage \u2013 mild to moderate brain damage often improves with time but severe brain damage is likely to be permanent; brain damage is more of a risk if diagnosis and treatment are delayed epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) meningitis \u2013 a life-threatening infection of the protective membranes around the brain, which requires urgent treatment; this is more common in children Page last reviewed: 20/06/2016 Next review due: 01/12/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Brain-abscess"},"Causes":{"Causes of a brain abscess ":"A brain abscess is usually caused by infection with either bacteria or fungi. If the immune system is unable to kill an infection, it will try to limit its spread by using healthy tissue to form an abscess, to stop the pus infecting other tissue. Infections of the brain are rare because the body has evolved a number of defences to protect this vital organ. One of these is the blood-brain barrier, a thick membrane that filters out impurities from blood before allowing it into your brain. However, in some cases, germs can get through these defences and infect the brain. Although the exact location of the original infection can't always be identified, the most common sources are described below. ","Infection after a head injury":"Direct trauma to the skull can also lead to a brain abscess and is thought to be responsible for 1 in 10 cases. The most commonly reported causes include: a skull fracture caused by penetrating injury to the head  a gunshot or shrapnel wound In rare cases, a brain abscess can develop as a complication of neurosurgery. Page last reviewed: 20/06/2016 Next review due: 01/12/2018 ","Infection in the skull":"In up to half of cases, the brain abscess occurs as a complication of a nearby infection in the skull, such as: a persistent middle ear infection (otitis media) sinusitis \u2013 an infection of the sinuses, the air-filled cavities inside the cheekbones and forehead mastoiditis \u2013 infection of the bone behind the eye This used to be a major cause of brain abscesses, but because of improved treatments for infections, a brain abscess is now a rare complication of these kinds of infection. ","Infection through the bloodstream":"Infections spread through the blood are thought to account for around one in four cases of brain abscesses. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of developing a brain abscess from a blood-borne infection. This is because their immune system may not be capable of fighting off the initial infection. You may have a weakened immune system if you: have a medical condition that weakens your immune system \u2013 such as HIV or AIDS receive medical treatment known to weaken the immune system \u2013 such as chemotherapy have an organ transplant and take immunosuppressant drugs to prevent your body rejecting the new organ The most commonly reported infections and health conditions that may cause a brain abscess are: cyanotic heart disease \u2013 a type of congenital heart disease (a heart defect present at birth) where the heart is unable to carry enough oxygen around the body; this lack of a regular oxygen supply makes the body more vulnerable to infection pulmonary arteriovenous fistula \u2013 a rare condition in which abnormal connections develop between blood vessels inside the lungs; this can allow bacteria to get into the blood and, eventually, the brain a dental abscess or treatment for tooth decay lung infections \u2013 such as pneumonia or bronchiectasis infections of the heart \u2013 such as endocarditis skin infections infections of the abdomen \u2013 such as peritonitis (an infection of the bowel lining) pelvic infections \u2013 such as infection of the bladder lining (cystitis) ","URL":"/conditions/Brain-abscess"},"Title":"Brain abscess"},"Anaphylactoid purpura":{"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a rare condition in which blood vessels become inflamed. It typically results in a rash and joint and tummy pain. HSP can affect people of any age, but the majority of cases occur in children under 10. The medical term for inflammation of the blood vessels is vasculitis. Blood vessels throughout the body become irritated and swollen, which can cause problems such as bleeding into the skin (resulting in a rash) and occasionally problems affecting the kidneys and bowel. HSP is not usually serious and most cases get better within a few weeks. ","Outlook":"HSP usually gets better on its own within about four to six weeks and doesn't generally cause any lasting problems. However, the condition can sometimes be severe and long-lasting \u2013 particularly in adults \u2013 and some people will get it more than once. Kidney problems usually pass without any complications or need for treatment, but in rare cases kidney failure or permanent kidney damage can develop. This is why it's important to check for any early signs of a problem with regular urine tests, as instructed by your doctor. Page last reviewed: 17/11/2014 Next review due: 17/11/2017 ","What causes HSP?":"HSP is caused by a problem with your immune system, possibly as a result of a previous infection. It has been known to occur after a bacterial or viral infection of the throat, airways or lungs (respiratory tract infection). HSP cannot be spread from person to person and doesn't usually run in families. ","Signs and symptoms":"The main symptoms of HSP are: a skin rash (purpura) that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots, usually on the buttocks, around the elbows and on the legs, and sometimes also on the face and upper body pain in the joints such as the knees and ankles, which can also become swollen, tender and warm tummy pain, which can develop suddenly before the rash appears HSP can also cause some other symptoms, including passing blood in your urine or stools, vomiting and diarrhoea. The condition is often associated with a previous infection (see below), so you or your child may initially have symptoms of an infection as well, such as a high temperature (fever) and feeling generally unwell. ","Diagnosing HSP":"Your GP may suspect HSP based on your symptoms and medical history. To confirm a diagnosis, you may need to be referred to a hospital doctor for the following tests: blood tests \u2013 to see how well the kidneys are working, or to look for recent signs of infection urine dipstick test \u2013 this is used to detect traces of blood or protein in the urine, as these are signs of a problem with the kidneys blood pressure tests \u2013 high blood pressure can also be a sign that the kidneys are affected skin biopsy \u2013 a very small sample of skin is sent to the laboratory to be examined under a microscope (this is only usually done if the doctor is not certain whether it is HSP) If kidney problems are suspected, an ultrasound scan of your tummy and kidneys may also be carried out and you may have a kidney biopsy. This is where a small sample of kidney cells are removed using a needle that is inserted into your lower back. ","Possible complications":"HSP will usually get better on its own without causing any further problems, but occasionally it can lead to potentially serious complications. The main complications associated with HSP are problems affecting the kidneys, which may not occur until several weeks or months after the other symptoms have passed. This can cause: blood in your urine protein in your urine \u2013 you won't be able to see this yourself, but it can sometimes cause your urine to become \"frothy\" high blood pressure (hypertension) swelling (oedema), particularly around the eyes and ankles These symptoms eventually get better in most people, but in a small proportion the kidneys can stop working properly (kidney failure). HSP can also sometimes cause other problems, such as swelling and pain in the testicles (orchitis) or an abnormal folding in the gut (intussusception) that can lead to a blockage in your bowel. ","Treating HSP":"HSP is not usually serious. Most people can be treated at home with only occasional appointments to monitor the condition, although in severe cases admission to hospital may be necessary. The rash, joint pain and tummy pain will usually get better over days or weeks without any treatment. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen may help relieve joint pain if needed, but you should check with your doctor before using these as they shouldn't be taken by people with kidney or bowel problems. Paracetamol may be a suitable alternative and resting can also help. A steroid medication such as prednisolone can sometimes help severe tummy pain. ","URL":"/conditions/henoch-schonlein-purpura","Follow-up":"Due to the risk of kidney problems, you or your child's urine and blood pressure will need to be tested regularly during and after treatment. This may be done during trips to your GP or visits from a community nurse, although you may sometimes be asked to check your child's urine yourself and seek further advice if the results suggest there is a problem.  The exact timing of these tests can vary, but they will usually start off being daily (if testing is done at home) or weekly at first and become less frequent over time. If no problems develop, monitoring can usually stop after around six months. If any problems are detected, you or your child will be referred to a specialist for further tests and any necessary treatment. If you are asked to check your or your child's urine, you will be given containers to use and a special dipstick that detects small amounts of blood or protein in urine. Your doctor or a nurse will tell you how to use these and how often a urine sample should be tested. You'll need to collect a urine sample first thing in the morning, as this gives the most accurate reading. Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about what the results of the test mean and what you should do if they suggest there is a problem. Regardless of your dipstick results, you should contact your GP, nurse or hospital if you or your child: pass red, rusty or blood-coloured urine pass stools with blood in them develop very painful and swollen joints develop severe tummy pain have swollen or painful testicles "},"Title":"Henoch-Schönlein purpura"},"Amnesia":{"Introduction":{"Common causes of memory loss":"GPs often find that people who see them about memory loss are most likely to have: anxiety stress depression Their memory loss is a result of poor concentration and not noticing things in the first place because of a lack of interest. Sleeping problems often make the memory loss worse. Your GP may suggest trying antidepressants. If you have depression or anxiety, your memory problems should get better as the depression or anxiety improves. An elderly person with memory loss is likely to have depression if they also experience changes in behaviour, such as hoarding or being bad tempered. Other common causes of memory loss are: a head injury \u2013 for example, after a car accident a stroke \u2013 this cuts off some of the blood supply to the brain and causes brain tissue to die These will cause sudden memory loss, where you either forget events that happened before the trauma (retrograde amnesia), or you forget everything that happened after the trauma (anterograde amnesia).  ","Less common causes of memory loss":"Less commonly, memory loss can be caused by: an underactive thyroid \u2013 where your thyroid gland (found in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones certain types of medication, such as sedatives and some treatments for Parkinson's disease long-term alcohol misuse bleeding in the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency \u2013 for example, as the result of a digestive problem transient global amnesia \u2013 problems with blood flow to part of the brain, which causes sudden episodes of memory loss that a person can't recall afterwards  psychogenic amnesia \u2013 a stressful or traumatic event that causes someone to block out the memory, leaving them unable to remember important information a brain tumour Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. ","Introduction ":"Memory loss, also called amnesia, happens when a person loses the ability to remember information and events they would normally be able to recall. It could be something that happened seconds or minutes ago, or a memorable event that occurred in the past. The loss of memory may have started suddenly, or it may have been getting worse over the last year or so. It's normal to become a bit forgetful as you get older. However, memory loss could be a symptom of something more serious and should be checked by a GP. Memory loss can be distressing for the person affected, and their family. Relatives may fear the worst and assume it's caused by dementia, but this often isn't the case. The following information will tell you: what to do if you're worried about memory loss how to tell if it could be caused by dementia the most common causes of memory loss (but don't rely on this to self-diagnose a condition) how to cope with a poor memory ","What to do if you're worried about memory loss":"See your GP if you're worried because you or someone you care for has lost their memory. They'll do an initial assessment and ask questions about symptoms, family history and lifestyle. They may also arrange a blood test. Memory loss has a wide range of possible causes, depending on the type of memory loss. Doctors classify memories as either: immediate memories \u2013 such as sounds, which are only stored for a few seconds short-term or recent memories \u2013 such as telephone numbers, which stay in your memory for 15 to 20 seconds; the brain can store about seven chunks of short-term information at any time long-term or remote memories \u2013 more permanent memories, which have been reinforced because you've repeatedly gone over them in your mind If your GP thinks you or your relative needs an assessment for dementia, or that there may be another more serious underlying condition, such as brain damage, they'll refer you to a specialist. ","Could memory loss be dementia?":"If you're reading this because you think your memory problems may be a sign of dementia, rest assured that they probably aren't. Your memory loss is more likely to be caused by something much more common and treatable, such as depression. A person with dementia won't usually be aware of their memory loss or may deny it. You may be worried that someone you care for has dementia. If your instincts are correct, their denial or lack of awareness of their memory loss can make it difficult to convince them to see a GP. This fact sheet includes information about how to persuade your relative to see a doctor (PDF, 848kb). As a general guide: Dementia usually occurs in people over the age of 65. The memory loss doesn't happen suddenly, but gets gradually worse over time. Someone with dementia will struggle to remember immediate or recent events, but can still recall events that happened a long time ago. This means that if their long-term memory is affected, it probably isn't dementia. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. ","Tips for coping with a poor memory":"Keep everyday items, such as car keys, in the same place and try to do things in the same order each time. Write information down, and keep paper and a pencil near the phone. Keep a diary at home as well as at work to remind you to do daily tasks. Use an alarm to help you remember to do something in the future, such as taking something out of the oven. Repeat important information you need to remember back to someone.

It typically takes between six and 12 weeks to heal. How to tell if your ankle is broken What to do Treatment Recovery Symptoms of a broken ankle include: severe pain and tenderness bruising and swelling difficulty moving your foot or putting weight on it the ankle being an odd shape (dislocated) a snap or grinding noise at the time of the injury bleeding (if the bone has damaged the skin) \u2013 sometimes the bone may poke through the skin Because of the shock and pain of breaking your ankle, you may also feel faint, dizzy or sick. It can be hard to tell the difference between a minor break and a sprain. It's best to assume it's a fracture until it has been checked by a doctor or nurse. If you think you or someone else has a broken ankle: go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance if it's a bad break \u2013 minor fractures can often be treated at a local minor injuries unit avoid moving or putting weight on the affected leg \u2013 try to keep it raised and supported (for example, on a cushion) stop any bleeding by applying pressure to the wound with a clean pad or dressing if possible apply an ice pack (such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to the ankle if one is easily available don't eat or drink anything in case you need surgery to fix the ankle when you get to hospital Ask a friend or relative to drive you to hospital and support your weight as you walk on your other foot. When you arrive at the hospital, you'll be given painkillers and an ankle support (splint) may be fixed to your ankle to secure it in position. An X-ray will usually be carried out to check whether your ankle is broken and how severe the break is. For a minor fracture: a supportive boot, splint or plaster cast will usually be fitted \u2013 sometimes this may be done a few days later, to allow any swelling to go down first (a splint may be left on until a boot or cast is fitted) you may be given crutches or a walking frame if your doctor advises you not to put weight on your ankle to begin with you'll be given painkillers to take home and told how to look after your boot or cast you'll probably be invited to follow-up appointments to check how your ankle is healing For more serious fractures: a doctor may try to realign the broken bones with their hands \u2013 this will usually be done while you're awake, but your leg will be numbed and you may be given medicine to relax you you may need surgery to realign the bones \u2013 this will often involve putting wires, plates, screws or rods inside your leg, but sometimes a temporary external frame is used a supportive boot or cast will usually be fitted before you go home you'll be invited to follow-up appointments to check how your ankle is healing The boot or cast will usually need to stay on for around six weeks, but it may be needed for longer if the break was severe and the bone is taking longer to heal. While your ankle is in a boot or cast: follow your doctor's advice about putting weight on your ankle \u2013 you may need to use crutches for a few weeks, but if the break is minor you may be able to walk on it straight away avoid activities such as carrying anything heavy, driving and sports \u2013 ask friends or family for help with things like shopping keep the boot or cast dry and keep your leg raised (for example, on pillows) whenever possible \u2013 read more about how to care for a plaster cast wiggle your toes and bend your knee regularly to reduce stiffness \u2013 your doctor or a physiotherapist will advise you about this get medical advice if you notice changes in your skin colour, unusual sensations in your leg or foot, signs of infection (redness, swelling or smelly discharge), severe or persistent pain, problems with your cast (it's too loose, too tight or cracked), or lower leg pain Speak to your doctor about when you can return to work and normal activities. They will probably suggest gradually increasing how much you use your ankle over a few weeks or months. Your ankle may be uncomfortable, swollen, stiff and weak after the boot or cast is removed. A physiotherapist can help with these problems, although sometimes they can last several months or more.

Antisocial personality disorder is a particularly challenging type of personality disorder, characterised by impulsive, irresponsible and often criminal behaviour. Someone with antisocial personality disorder will typically be manipulative, deceitful and reckless, and won't care for other people's feelings. Like other types of personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder is on a spectrum, which means it can range in severity from occasional bad behaviour to repeatedly breaking the law and committing serious crimes. Psychopaths are considered to have a severe form of antisocial personality disorder. ","Treating antisocial personality disorder":"In the past, antisocial personality disorder was thought to be a lifelong disorder, but that's not always the case and it can sometimes be managed and treated. Evidence suggests that behaviour can improve over time with therapy, even if core characteristics such as lack of empathy remain.  However, antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat. A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court. The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse. The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care. In some cases, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidelines about the management and prevention of antisocial personality disorder. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder. It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder. The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour. Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons. DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs. It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community. There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work. The recommended length of treatment is 18 months as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice. Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme. For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups and be subject to the democratic process. The Ministry of Justice has more information about DTC in their guide Working with personality disordered offenders (PDF, 969kb). There's little evidence to support the use of medication for treating antisocial personality disorder, although certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medications may be helpful in some instances. Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms. ","Who develops antisocial personality disorder?":"Antisocial personality disorder affects more men than women. It's not known why some people develop antisocial personality disorder, but both genetics and traumatic childhood experiences, such as child abuse or neglect, are thought to play a role. A person with antisocial personality disorder will have often grown up in difficult family circumstances. One or both parents may misuse alcohol, and parental conflict and harsh, inconsistent parenting are common. As a result of these problems, social services may become involved with the child's care. These types of difficulties in childhood will often lead to behavioural problems during adolescence and adulthood. ","About personality disorders":"Personality disorders affect how someone thinks, perceives, feels or relates to others. They range from mild to severe. The signs typically emerge in adolescence and persist into adulthood. People with personality disorders often have other mental health problems, particularly depression and substance misuse. Personality disorders may be associated with genetic and family factors, and experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common. Although personality disorders may run in families, psychopathy is thought to have a higher genetic component. Treatment for personality disorders usually involves a course of psychological therapy. Page last reviewed: 09/06/2015 Next review due: 01/06/2018 ","Effects of antisocial personality disorder":"Criminal behaviour is a key feature of antisocial personality disorder, and there's a high risk that someone with the disorder will commit crimes and be imprisoned at some point in their life. Men with antisocial personality disorder have been found to be three to five times more likely to misuse alcohol and drugs than those without the disorder, and have an increased risk of dying prematurely as a result of reckless behaviour or attempting suicide. People with antisocial personality disorder are also more likely to have relationship problems during adulthood and be unemployed and homeless. ","Signs of antisocial personality disorder":"A person with antisocial personality disorder may: exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships be unable to control their anger lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes blame others for problems in their lives repeatedly break the law A person with antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder during childhood, such as truancy (not going to school), delinquency \u2013 for example, committing crimes or substance misuse \u2013 and other disruptive and aggressive behaviours. ","Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder":"To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person must have a history of conduct disorder before the age of 15. Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed after rigorous psychological assessment. A diagnosis can only be made if the person is aged 18 years or older and at least three of the following criteria apply: repeatedly breaking the law repeatedly being deceitful being impulsive or incapable of planning ahead being irritable and aggressive having a reckless disregard for their safety or the safety of others being consistently irresponsible lack of remorse These signs must not be part of a schizophrenic or manic episode \u2013 they must be part of the person's everyday personality. This behaviour usually becomes most extreme and challenging during the late teens and early 20s. It may improve by the time the person reaches their 40s.

Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. ","Common accidents and emergencies":"Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don't remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it's minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn't stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body\u2019s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that's wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 20 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it's attached to the skin if you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don't wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don't apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it\u2019s in their mouth don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn\u2019t work, start back blows (see below). If choking is severe, the person won\u2019t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they\u2019ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person\u2019s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn\u2019t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn't clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water to help unless it's absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they're not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you're alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don't stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can't reach the mains supply: don't go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn\u2019t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It's always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate \u2013 for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they\u2019re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don't move them and call an ambulance it's obvious they have a broken leg, don't move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don't move them and call an ambulance Don't give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain \u2013 the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body \u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin \u2013 for example, if they're under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what's been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don't perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don't leave them if they're unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who's been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).

Putting someone in the recovery position will keep their airway clear and open. It also ensures that any vomit or fluid won't cause them to choke. The video on this page shows a step-by-step guide to putting someone in the recovery position. Or you can follow these steps: with the person lying on their back, kneel on the floor at their side place the arm nearest you at a right angle to their body with their hand upwards, towards the head tuck their other hand under the side of their head, so that the back of their hand is touching their cheek bend the knee farthest from you to a right angle carefully roll the person onto their side by pulling on the bent knee the top arm should be supporting the head and the bottom arm will stop you rolling them too far open their airway by gently tilting their head back and lifting their chin, and check that nothing is blocking their airway stay with the person and monitor their condition until help arrives ","Spinal injury":"If you think a person may have a spinal injury, don't attempt to move them until the emergency services reach you. If it's necessary to open their airway, place your hands on either side of their head and gently lift their jaw with your fingertips to open the airway. Take care not to move their neck. You should suspect a spinal injury if the person: has been involved in an incident that's directly affected their spine, such as a fall from height or being struck directly in the back complains of severe pain in their neck or back won't move their neck feels weak, numb or paralysed has lost control of their limbs, bladder or bowels Page last reviewed: 08/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Accidents-and-first-aid"},"Title":"First aid","After an incident":{"First aid courses":"These pages provide information and guidance about common first aid situations.

","Breathing":"To check if a person is still breathing: look to see if their chest is rising and falling listen over their mouth and nose for breathing sounds  feel their breath against your cheek for 10 seconds If they're breathing normally, place them in the recovery position so their airway remains clear of obstructions and continue to monitor normal breathing. Gasping or irregular breathing is not normal breathing. If the casualty isn't breathing, call 999 or 112 for an ambulance and then begin CPR. ","Airway":"If the casualty appears unresponsive, ask them loudly if they're OK and if they can open their eyes. If they respond, you can leave them in the position they're in until help arrives. While you wait, keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response: Are they alert? Do they respond to your voice? Do they respond to pain? Is there no response to any stimulus (are they unconscious)? If there's no response, leave the casualty in the position they're in and open their airway. If this isn't possible in the position they're in, gently lay them on their back and open their airway. To open the airway, place one hand on the casualty\u2019s forehead and gently tilt their head back, lifting the tip of the chin using two fingers. This moves the tongue away from the back of the throat. Don't push on the floor of the mouth, as this will push the tongue upwards and obstruct the airway. If you think the person may have a spinal injury, place your hands on either side of their head and use your fingertips to gently lift the angle of the jaw forward and upwards, without moving the head, to open the airway. Take care not to move the casualty\u2019s neck. However, opening the airway takes priority over a neck injury. This is known as the jaw thrust technique.

"}},"Androgen insensitivity syndrome":{"Introduction":{"Information about your child":"If your child has AIS, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. ","Introduction ":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a rare condition that affects the development of a child's genitals and reproductive organs. A child born with AIS is genetically male, but the external appearance of their genitals may be female or somewhere between male and female. Someone with AIS may benefit from psychological support, and in some cases may have treatment to alter the appearance of their genitals. Most people born with the condition are unable to have children, but they'll otherwise be perfectly healthy and able to lead a normal life. ","Living with AIS":"Children with AIS and their parents are supported by a team of specialists, who will offer ongoing care and support. They will help you decide whether to raise your child as a girl or a boy while they're still very young. Most children with CAIS are raised as girls, while those with PAIS can be brought up either as girls or boys. It's up to you as a parent, with help from specialists, to decide what you think is in the best interests of your child. Once you've decided, you can learn about the treatments available that can help make your child's body look more consistent with the chosen gender and help them develop more naturally. This may involve surgery to alter the appearance or function of their genitals, and hormone treatment to encourage female or male development during puberty. Read more about how AIS is treated. ","What causes AIS?":"AIS is caused by a genetic fault that's usually passed on to a child by their mother. This genetic fault means that, despite being genetically male, the body doesn't respond to testosterone (the male sex hormone) properly and male sexual development doesn't happen as normal. This means the penis doesn't form or is underdeveloped. The child's genitals may appear female, or between male and female, but they don't have a womb or ovaries and have fully or partially undescended testicles. Women who carry the genetic fault won't have AIS themselves, but there's a one in four chance each child they have will be born with the condition. Read more about the causes of AIS. ","Gender identity and gender dysphoria":"Most children with AIS grow up to feel they are the gender their parents chose to raise them as. This feeling is known as their gender identity. In a few cases, older children and adults with AIS feel their gender identity doesn't match the gender they've been raised as. This is known as gender dysphoria. People with gender dysphoria often have a desire to live as a member of the opposite sex, and may want treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity. If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be told about the issues of gender identity that could arise as your child gets older. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome","Types of AIS":"There are two main types of AIS, which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone. These are: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) \u2013 where testosterone has no effect on sexual development, so the genitals are entirely female partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) \u2013 where testosterone still has some effect on sexual development, so the genitals are often between male and female PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different. CAIS can be more difficult to spot, as the genitals usually look normal for a girl. It's often not diagnosed until puberty, when periods don't start and pubic and underarm hair doesn't develop. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and diagnosing AIS. ","Support and advice":"You and your child will be offered psychological support to help you understand and cope with the diagnosis of AIS. Children may not need this while they're very young, but they usually do as they get older. You'll be given advice about how and when to discuss the condition with your child. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (AISSG) and DSD Families. "},"Causes":{"How babies with AIS develop":"In early pregnancy, all unborn babies have identical genitals. As they grow inside the womb, they develop either male or female genitals, depending on the pair of sex chromosomes they receive from their parents and their ability to respond to the sex hormones they make. Sex chromosomes are bundles of genes \u2013 called X or Y \u2013 that play a vital role in a baby's sexual development. Females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), while males usually have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Children with AIS have male (XY) chromosomes, but the genetic fault they inherit prevents their body responding to the testosterone they make. This means male sexual development doesn't happen as normal. The genitals appear female or between male and female, but a womb and ovaries don't develop internally. ","How AIS is passed on":"In most cases, the genetic fault is passed on to a child by their mother. The faulty gene is found on the mother's X chromosome. As the mother has two X chromosomes, the normal chromosome is able to make up for the faulty one, so she is a carrier of the faulty gene, but doesn't have AIS and is able to have children. Any genetically female (XX) children the mother has will also inherit two X chromosomes and will be unaffected, although they too may be carriers and be able to pass the genetic fault on to any children they have. If the mother has a genetically male (XY) child, there's a chance they could pass on the faulty X chromosome, in addition to the Y chromosome the child gets from their father. If this happens, the Y chromosome won't be able to make up for the faulty X chromosome and the baby will develop AIS. This means women who carry the faulty X chromosome have a: one in four chance of giving birth to a girl who is unaffected, but can pass on the altered gene to her children one in four chance of having a boy who is unaffected one in four chance of having a girl who is unaffected and doesn't carry the altered gene one in four chance of having a child with AIS This is known as X-linked inheritance. Read about genetic inheritance for more information. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Causes of androgen insensitivity syndrome ":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is caused by a genetic fault that means the body can't respond to testosterone properly. The faulty gene is usually passed on to a child by their mother. Testosterone is the sex hormone produced by the testicles. It controls the development of the usual changes expected in boys, such as penis growth and the testicles moving into the scrotum. ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome"},"Title":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome","Diagnosis":{"Appearance and sexual development":"Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is usually spotted soon after birth because the genitals have an unusual appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) isn't usually diagnosed at birth because the genitals look normal for a girl, although the condition may be picked up if the child develops a hernia. Hernias are where an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the surrounding tissue. They can occur in babies with CAIS as a result of the testicles failing to move from the tummy into the scrotum. When the baby has an operation to repair the hernia, the surgeon may find the testicles inside the hernia or in the tummy, and tests may be arranged to check for CAIS. If a baby with CAIS doesn't develop a hernia, the condition may go undiagnosed until puberty, when she doesn't start having periods and doesn't develop pubic and underarm hair. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and types of AIS. ","Testing family members and unborn babies":"If someone in your family has AIS and the specific genetic fault causing it has been identified, it may be possible to have a blood test to check if you carry the same fault and are at risk of passing it on to any children you have. Testing can also be carried out in unborn babies when there's a known family history of AIS. There are two main tests that can be carried out during pregnancy to determine whether a baby has the condition: chorionic villus sampling (CVS) \u2013 a sample of cells are removed from the afterbirth (placenta) for testing, usually with a needle; this is usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy amniocentesis \u2013 a needle is used to extract a sample of the fluid surrounding the baby, called amniotic fluid, for testing; this is usually carried out between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy It can be difficult to decide whether or not to have these tests, so it's a good idea to speak to a genetic counsellor first. It's also important to be aware CVS and amniocentesis are estimated to carry around a 1 in 100 chance of causing a miscarriage. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Diagnosing androgen insensitivity syndrome ":"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is sometimes diagnosed soon after a baby is born, although often it's not noticed until a child reaches puberty. Doctors may suspect AIS based on a child's appearance and sexual development, but some tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome","Tests and scans":"If AIS is suspected, blood tests can be used to: check the sex chromosomes \u2013 sex chromosomes are bundles of genetic material that determine a person's genetic sex; if their genetic sex is different from their physical appearance, they may have AIS check for a genetic fault \u2013 AIS is caused by a problem on the X chromosome, the sex chromosome a child with AIS receives from their mother measure sex hormone levels \u2013 children with AIS tend to have high levels of testosterone (the male sex hormone) in their blood An ultrasound scan can also be carried out to confirm the absence of the womb and ovaries. Children with AIS often have female genitals, but no female internal reproductive organs. If a surgeon thinks they've found testicles in a baby's tummy during a hernia repair operation, a small tissue sample (biopsy) may be taken and analysed to confirm they are testicles and not ovaries. "},"Living with":{"Support for parents":"If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be offered counselling to help you come to terms with your emotions. A diagnosis of AIS can come as a shock to parents, and feelings of shame, guilt, anger and anxiety are common. Talking to other parents who have a child with AIS may also help. There are organisations that can put you in touch with other families affected by the condition. You can find contact details for the AIS Support Group (AISSG) on their website, or call the Contact a Family helpline on 0808 808 3555. ","Choosing your child's gender":"As a parent of a child with AIS, one of the biggest decisions you'll have to make will be to choose which gender to raise your child as. You'll be given lots of information to help you make this decision.  Most parents of children with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) choose to raise their child as a girl, as they have female genitals and often ultimately end up identifying with being female. The decision is more difficult if your child has partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), as their genitals may have both male and female aspects. You're entitled to specialist advice about your child's future development and any gender identity issues that could arise later on. Most children with PAIS stay with the gender they've been raised as. However, some people feel this doesn't represent who they are and decide to switch gender in later life. ","Hormone therapy":"If the testicles are removed when a girl with CAIS is a child, treatment with the hormone oestrogen (the female sex hormone) is usually started at the age of 10 or 11, so female development begins at an age consistent with puberty. This won't cause periods to start, as people with CAIS don't have a womb, but it will help them develop a more female body shape. It will also be continued after puberty to stop them developing menopausal symptoms and weak bones (osteoporosis). Women with CAIS who had their testicles removed after puberty will also need to take oestrogen to prevent the menopause and osteoporosis. Children with PAIS may also need to take hormone supplements. Girls with PAIS who have their testicles removed may need oestrogen to encourage puberty. Boys with PAIS may need androgens (male sex hormones) to encourage certain male characteristics, such as the growth of facial hair, penis growth, or deepening of the voice. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Surgery":"Children with CAIS and PAIS will sometimes need surgery to help change their body and genitals to be more consistent with the gender they're raised as. Some procedures may be best carried out while your child is still young, but others can be delayed until they're older. Children with AIS sometimes develop a hernia (where an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the surrounding tissue) soon after birth. This is a result of their testicles failing to move from the tummy to the scrotum. This can be repaired by closing and strengthening the gap created in the surrounding tissues. The testicles may also be removed during another operation. Girls with CAIS will usually have their internal testicles removed, as there's a very small risk they could become cancerous if left in place. This procedure is often delayed until after puberty because the testicles produce hormones that help girls with CAIS develop a normal female body shape without hormone treatment, and the risk of the testicles becoming cancerous before adulthood is extremely low. If you decide you'd prefer for your child's testicles to be removed before puberty, hormone treatment will be needed to help them develop a more female body shape. Boys with PAIS may be born with fully or partially undescended testicles. If this happens, an operation can be carried out to move the testicles into the scrotum. Read more about treating undescended testicles. Surgery can also be carried out to straighten the penis and correct hypospadias, where the hole that carries urine out of the body is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the end. Girls with AIS often have a shorter vagina than normal, which can make having sex difficult. Treatment for this is usually delayed until after puberty, so she can decide if she wants treatment for it and choose what treatment she prefers. In many cases, surgery isn't necessary because the vagina can be lengthened using a method called dilation. This involves inserting small plastic rods that gradually widen and deepen the vagina. Alternatively, a procedure to remove skin and tissue from the genital area and use it to reconstruct the vagina can be carried out. Women with PAIS can also have surgery to reduce the size of their clitoris. This may make it less sensitive, but achieving an orgasm should still be possible. Boys with PAIS will sometimes experience some breast development around puberty. If this occurs, an operation can be carried out to remove the breast tissue. Read more about male breast reductions. ","Talking to your child about AIS":"Parents often wonder when and what they should say to their child about their condition. Many people feel it's best to explain the basic facts about AIS to the child as soon as possible. They can then be given more detailed information as they get older, as their ability to understand increases. It's usually recommended that a child fully understands their condition before they reach puberty. This can be a stressful time anyway, but it could be very traumatic if your child starts puberty without knowing about the possible changes they may experience, or the differences between them and their friends. The situation can be more difficult if a girl with CAIS isn't diagnosed until she has started puberty. The health professionals looking after your child can advise you on how to talk to your child and support you through this process. ","Support for children":"Some young children with AIS don't need psychological support because their condition is completely natural to them. However, as a child gets older, they may need support from a therapist with experience in AIS to help them understand and cope with their condition. A long-term relationship between the child and therapist is ideal so any new issues can be discussed as the child matures. ","URL":"/conditions/Androgen-insensitivity-syndrome","Living with androgen insensitivity syndrome ":"Children with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and their parents will be supported by a team of specialists who can offer ongoing information and care. Various treatment options are available to someone with AIS, including reconstructive surgery and hormone therapy. However, psychological support and advice to help you deal with any issues that arise as a result of your child's condition is probably the most important aspect of care. With appropriate care and support, most people with AIS are able to come to terms with their condition and lead normal lives. "},"Symptoms":{"Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome":"The development of children with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) can vary. In many cases, the genitalia are between male and female from birth. For example, affected babies may have: a very small penis or an enlarged clitoris (the sexual organ that helps women reach sexual climax) partially undescended testicles hypospadias \u2013 where the hole that carries urine out of the body is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the end Children with PAIS are usually raised as boys, although they may experience poor penis development during puberty and develop small breasts. Most children with PAIS raised as boys will be infertile. Some children with PAIS are raised as girls. Like those with CAIS, girls with PAIS will not have a womb or ovaries and will be unable to get pregnant.

There are two main types of AIS, which affect people in different ways: complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS) The main features of these two types are outlined below. Read more about the types of AIS. ","Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome":"CAIS isn't usually obvious from birth, as affected babies have female genitals \u2013 including a vagina and labia (flaps of skin either side of the vaginal opening) \u2013 and are raised as girls. They'll also have undescended testicles, but this won't be obvious unless they cause a hernia (where they push through a weakness in the surrounding tissue) or swelling in the labia. The first obvious symptoms often don't appear until puberty, which starts at around the age of 11. When a girl with CAIS reaches puberty, she will: not start having periods develop little or no pubic and underarm hair develop breasts and have growth spurts as normal, although she may end up slightly taller than usual for a girl Girls with CAIS don't have a womb or ovaries, so are unable to get pregnant. Their vagina will also be shorter than normal, which may make having sex difficult.

Infection can occur if there are bacteria on your skin or on the instruments being used. However, severe infection occurs in less than 1 in every 1,000 procedures. ","Injury from the needle":"During amniocentesis, the placenta (the organ that links the mother's blood supply to her unborn baby's) may be punctured by the needle. It's sometimes necessary for the needle to enter the placenta to access the amniotic fluid. If this happens, the puncture wound usually heals without any more problems developing. An ultrasound scanner is now commonly used to guide the needle, significantly reducing the risk of injury. ","Risks of amniocentesis ":"Before you decide to have amniocentesis, you'll be told about the risks and possible complications. The main risks associated with the procedure are outlined below. ","Rhesus disease":"If your blood type is rhesus (RhD) negative, but your baby's blood type is RhD positive, it's possible for sensitisation to occur during amniocentesis. This is where some of your baby's blood enters your bloodstream and your body starts to produce antibodies to attack it. If it's not treated, this can cause the baby to develop rhesus disease. If you don't already know your blood type, a blood test will be carried out before amniocentesis to see if there's a risk of sensitisation. An injection of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin can be given to stop sensitisation occurring, if necessary. Read more about preventing rhesus disease. ","Club foot":"Having amniocentesis early (before week 15 of the pregnancy) has been associated with an increased risk of the unborn baby developing club foot. Club foot, also known as talipes, is a deformity of the ankle and foot that's present at birth (congenital). Because of the increased risk of a baby developing club foot, amniocentesis isn't recommended before 15 weeks of pregnancy. Page last reviewed: 21/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Inconclusive results":"After having amniocentesis, it can be reassuring if the results indicate that your developing baby has normal chromosomes and that there are no signs of any developmental problems. However, you should be aware that amniocentesis can't test for every condition or disease, and it can't guarantee your baby will be born completely healthy. Read more about the results of amniocentesis.  ","Miscarriage":"There's a small risk of miscarriage (loss of the pregnancy) occurring in any pregnancy, regardless of whether or not you have amniocentesis. If you have amniocentesis after 15 weeks of pregnancy, the chance of having a miscarriage is estimated to be about 1%. The risk is higher if the procedure is carried out before 15 weeks. It's not known for certain why amniocentesis can lead to a miscarriage. However, it may be caused by factors such as infection, bleeding or damage to the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby. Most miscarriages that happen after amniocentesis occur within 72 hours of the procedure. However, in some cases a miscarriage can occur later than this (up to two weeks afterwards).

The most common neural tube defect is spina bifida, which can cause learning difficulties and paralysis (weakness) of the lower limbs. ","Deciding whether to have amniocentesis":"If you're offered CVS, ask your doctor or midwife what the procedure involves and what the risks and benefits are before deciding whether to have it. You may also find it helpful to contact a support group, such as Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC). ARC is a charity that offers information, advice and support on all issues related to screening during pregnancy. The test will usually tell you whether your baby will be born with any of the genetic conditions that were tested for. If no problem is found, it may be reassuring. A result showing that a genetic condition was detected will give you plenty of time to decide how you want to proceed with your pregnancy.

During the test, a long, thin needle is inserted through your abdominal wall, guided by an ultrasound image. The needle is passed into the amniotic sac that surrounds the foetus and a small sample of amniotic fluid is removed for analysis. The test itself usually takes about 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes. Amniocentesis is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful. Some women describe experiencing a pain similar to period pain or feeling pressure when the needle is taken out. Read more about what happens during amniocentesis. ","Getting your results":"The first results of the test should be available within three working days and this will tell you whether Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome has been discovered. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back. If your test shows that your baby has a genetic or chromosomal condition, the implications will be fully discussed with you. There's no cure for most of the conditions amniocentesis finds, so you'll need to consider your options carefully. You may choose to continue with your pregnancy, while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared, or you may consider having a termination (abortion). Read more about the results of amniocentesis. ","When amniocentesis is offered":"Amniocentesis isn't routinely offered to all pregnant women. It's only offered if there's a higher chance your baby could have a genetic condition. This could be because: an antenatal screening test has suggested there may be a problem, such as Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.  you've had a previous pregnancy with these problems you have a family history of a genetic condition, such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy, and an abnormality is detected in your baby during a routine ultrasound scan It's important to remember that you don't have to have amniocentesis if it's offered. It's up to you to decide whether you want it. Your midwife or doctor will speak to you about what the test involves, and let you know what the possible benefits and risks are, to help you make a decision. Read more about why amniocentesis is offered and deciding whether to have it. ","What are the risks of amniocentesis?":"Before you decide to have amniocentesis, the risks and possible complications will be discussed with you. One of the main risks associated with amniocentesis is miscarriage, which is the loss of the pregnancy in the first 23 weeks. This is estimated to occur in 0.5% to 1% of women who have amniocentesis. There are also some other risks, such as infection or needing to have the procedure again because it wasn't possible to accurately test the first sample that was removed. The risk of amniocentesis causing complications is higher if it's carried out before the 15th week of pregnancy, which is why the test is only carried out after this point. Read more about the possible complications of amniocentesis. ","URL":"/conditions/Amniocentesis","What are the alternatives?":"An alternative to amniocentesis is a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This is where a small sample of cells from the placenta (the organ that links the mother's blood supply with her unborn baby's) are removed for testing. It's usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary. With CVS, the risk of miscarriage is similar to the risk of miscarriage for amniocentesis. However, as the test can be carried out earlier, you'll have more time to consider the results. If you're offered tests to look for a genetic or chromosomal condition in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you, and help you make a decision.

Amniotic fluid surrounds the foetus (unborn baby) in the womb (uterus). ","Ultrasound scan":"You'll have an ultrasound scan before and during amniocentesis. An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your womb that's relayed to a monitor. The ultrasound scan allows healthcare professionals to: check the position of the foetus find the best place to remove some amniotic fluid ensure the needle can pass safely through the walls of your abdomen (belly) and womb ","Anaesthetic":"Before the needle is inserted into your abdomen, the area may be numbed with anaesthetic. This involves having a small injection into your belly that may sting slightly. However, anaesthetic isn't usually necessary because research suggests that it doesn't have much effect in most cases. ","Getting the results":"The first results should be available within a few days, and this will tell you whether a major chromosome problem has been discovered. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back.

A long, thin needle is then inserted through your abdominal wall. It may cause a sharp, stinging sensation. Using the ultrasound image as a guide, the needle is passed into the amniotic sac that surrounds the foetus. A syringe is then used to remove a small sample of the amniotic fluid, which will be sent to a laboratory for analysis. In about 8 out of every 100 women who have amniocentesis, not enough fluid is removed the first time the needle is inserted. If this happens, the needle will be inserted again.  ","Is amniocentesis painful?":"Amniocentesis isn't usually painful, but you may feel uncomfortable during the procedure. Some women describe experiencing a pain similar to period pain or feeling pressure when the needle is taken out. ","Preparing for amniocentesis":"You won't usually need to do anything special to prepare for amniocentesis. You can eat and drink as normal beforehand. In some cases, you may be advised to avoid going to the toilet for a few hours before the test, because it's sometimes easier to perform when your bladder is full. Your doctor or midwife will tell you about this before you attend your appointment. You may want to bring a partner, friend or family member for support when you have the test. ","How long does it take?":"The procedure usually takes around 10 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you will be monitored for up to an hour, in case the test causes any side effects, such as heavy bleeding. You can then go home to rest. It's a good idea to arrange for someone to drive you home, as you might not feel up to it yourself. ","URL":"/conditions/Amniocentesis","Recovering after amniocentesis":"After amniocentesis, it's normal to have cramps similar to period pain and light vaginal bleeding called \"spotting\" for a day or two. You can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol (but not ibuprofen or aspirin) if you experience any discomfort. You may wish to avoid any strenuous activity for the rest of the day. Contact your midwife or the hospital where the procedure was carried out for advice as soon as possible if you develop any of the following symptoms after the procedure: persistent or severe pain a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or more chills or shivering discharge or clear fluid coming from the vagina contractions (when your abdomen tightens then relaxes) "},"Results":{"Getting the results":"The first results should be available within three working days, and this will tell you whether a major chromosome problem such as Down's syndrome has been found.

They're also sometimes used to prevent motion sickness and as a short-term treatment for sleeping difficulties (insomnia). Most antihistamines can be bought from pharmacies and shops, but some are only available on prescription. This page covers: Types of antihistamines How to take them Side effects Taking them with other medicines, food or alcohol Who can take them \u2013 including pregnancy advice How they work There are many types of antihistamine. They're usually divided into two main groups: older antihistamines that make you feel sleepy \u2013 such as chlorphenamine, hydroxyzine and promethazine newer, non-drowsy antihistamines that are less likely to make you feel sleepy \u2013 such as cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine They also come in several different forms \u2013 including tablets, capsules, liquids, syrups, creams, lotions, gels, eye drops and nasal sprays. ","Which type is best?":"There's not much evidence to suggest any particular antihistamine is better than any other at relieving allergy symptoms. Some people find certain types work well for them and others do not. You may need to try more than one type to find one that works for you. Non-drowsy antihistamines are generally the best option, as they're less likely to make you feel sleepy. But types that make you feel sleepy may be better if your symptoms affect your sleep. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're unsure which medicine to try. Not all antihistamines are suitable for everyone \u2013 see who can take antihistamines for more information. Take your medicine as advised by your pharmacist or doctor, or as described in the leaflet that comes with it. Before taking an antihistamine, you should know: how to take it \u2013 including whether it needs to be taken with water or food, or how to use it correctly (if eye drops or a nasal spray) how much to take (the dose) \u2013 this can vary depending on things such as your age and weight when to take it \u2013 including how many times a day you can take it and when to take it (older types should be taken before bedtime) how long to take it for \u2013 some types can be used for a long time, but some are only recommended for a few days what to do if you miss a dose or take too much (overdose) The advice varies depending on the exact medicine you're taking. If you're not sure how to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist. Like all medicines, antihistamines can cause side effects. Side effects of older types of antihistamines can include: sleepiness (drowsiness) and reduced co-ordination, reaction speed and judgement \u2013 don't drive or use machinery after taking these antihistamines because of this risk dry mouth blurred vision difficulty emptying your bladder Side effects of non-drowsy antihistamines can include: headache dry mouth feeling sick drowsiness \u2013 this is less common than with older types of antihistamines Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects and advice about when to get medical help. If you think your medicine has caused an unwanted side effect, you can report it through the Yellow Card Scheme. Speak to a pharmacist or your GP before taking antihistamines if you're already taking other medicines. There may be a risk the medicines could affect each other, which could stop either from working properly or increase the risk of side effects. Examples of medicines that could cause problems if taken with antihistamines include some types of: antidepressants stomach ulcer or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) medicines cough and cold remedies that also contain an antihistamine It's best to avoid alcohol while taking an antihistamine, particularly if you're taking an older type of antihistamine, as this can increase the chances of it making you feel sleepy. Food and other drinks don't affect most antihistamines, but check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to make sure. Most people can safely take antihistamines.

Your pharmacist or doctor can recommend one that's best for you. Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine to check it's safe for you before taking it or giving it to your child. Antihistamines work by stopping a substance called histamine affecting the cells in your body. Histamine is a chemical released when the body detects something harmful, such as an infection. It causes blood vessels to expand and the skin to swell (known as inflammation), which helps protect the body. But in people with allergies, the body mistakes something harmless, such as pollen, for a threat. It then produces histamine, which causes symptoms such as rashes, a runny nose and/or sneezing. Antihistamines help stop this happening if you take them before you come into contact with the substance you're allergic to. Or they can reduce the severity of symptoms if taken afterwards. If you no longer have the leaflet that came with your medicine, you can search for an online version of it on the following websites: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA): patient information leaflets Electronic Medicines Compendium The leaflet will have detailed information about your particular medicine, including how to take it and what side effects you might get.

It's often used for short-term relief from: headaches and migraines toothache period pains general aches and pains colds and flu Long-term treatment with low doses of aspirin \u2013 usually 75mg \u2013 has an antiplatelet effect, which means it makes the blood less sticky and can stop blood clots developing. A doctor may recommend this if you have or have had: a heart attack or angina a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) coronary artery bypass surgery or another operation on your heart or blood vessels Aspirin may also be prescribed for children after heart surgery or to treat Kawasaki disease. But it shouldn't be given to anyone under 16 years old without medical supervision. Most people can take aspirin safely. But you should get advice from a pharmacist or doctor before taking it if you: have had an allergic reaction to aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, in the past have asthma have had stomach ulcers in the past have severe liver or kidney problems have haemophilia or another bleeding disorder have uncontrolled high blood pressure are looking for medication for a child under 16 \u2013 medication containing aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16 are over 65 years of age are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to get pregnant are taking other medications \u2013 see Interactions with other medicines, below You may still be able to take aspirin in these cases, but you should only do so if advised that it's safe by a healthcare professional. If you can't take aspirin, a different medicine, such as paracetamol (for pain) or clopidogrel (to prevent blood clots), may be recommended instead. Your pharmacist or doctor can tell you how often to take your aspirin and how much you should take. You can also check the recommendations in the leaflet that comes with your medicine. Generally speaking: high-dose aspirin (to relieve pain) can be taken three or four times a day, with at least four hours between each dose, until your symptoms improve low-dose aspirin (to prevent blood clots) is taken once a day, usually for the rest of your life Some medicine leaflets advise taking aspirin with water, while others may recommend taking it before or after food.  Follow the instructions in the leaflet or label that comes with your medicine. Ask your pharmacist if you're not sure. Like all medications, there's a risk of side effects from aspirin. The most common side effects are:  indigestion and stomach aches \u2013 taking your medicine with food may help reduce this risk bleeding or bruising more easily than normal Uncommon and rare side effects include: hives \u2013 a raised, itchy rash tinnitus \u2013 hearing sounds that come from inside your body breathing difficulties or an asthma attack an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause breathing problems, swelling of the mouth, lips or throat, and a sudden rash bleeding in the stomach \u2013 this can cause dark, tar-like stools or vomiting blood bleeding in the brain \u2013 this can cause a sudden, severe headache, vision problems and stroke symptoms, such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body Speak to your doctor if you experience any concerning or troublesome side effects while taking aspirin. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you're having a severe allergic reaction, or you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach or brain. Aspirin can potentially interact with other medications, including some complementary and herbal medicines, which could alter their effects or increase your risk of side effects. Medicines that can interact with aspirin include: NSAIDs \u2013 such as ibuprofen or naproxen steroid medication \u2013 such as prednisolone anticoagulant medicines \u2013 such as warfarin or heparin SSRI antidepressants \u2013 such as citalopram, fluoxetine or paroxetine some medications used to treat high blood pressure \u2013 such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics some medicines used to treat epilepsy \u2013 such as phenytoin other medicines containing aspirin \u2013 including cold and flu remedies where aspirin is one of the ingredients This is not a complete list. If you want to check whether a medicine is safe to take with aspirin, ask your doctor or pharmacist, or read the leaflet that comes with the medicine. There are no known interactions between aspirin and food. The risk of bleeding in the stomach may be higher if you drink alcohol while taking aspirin, so you may want to consider reducing how much you drink or avoiding alcohol completely. If you're taking aspirin to reduce your risk of blood clots and you forget to take a dose, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of aspirin as normal. If it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular schedule. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you think you've taken too much aspirin (overdose) and have any concerns, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111.

Infections can occur during breastfeeding if bacteria enter your breast tissue, or if the milk ducts (tiny tubes) become blocked. This can cause mastitis which, if not treated, can result in an abscess forming. Women who aren't breastfeeding can also develop mastitis if bacteria enter the milk ducts through a sore or cracked nipple, or a nipple piercing. White blood cells are sent to attack the infection, which causes tissue at the site of the infection to die. This creates a small, hollow area that fills with pus (an abscess). Read more about what causes breast abscesses. ","How common are breast abscesses?":"Breast abscesses most commonly affect women who are 18-50 years of age. They're often linked to mastitis, which affects up to 1 in 10 breastfeeding women and causes the breast to become red and sore.

This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body. ","URL":"/conditions/Breast-abscess"},"Causes":{"Bacterial infection":"Most abscesses are caused by bacterial infections. The most common bacteria that causes mastitis is Staphylococcus aureus. The bacteria usually enter the breast through small cracks or breaks in the skin of the nipple, which can sometimes develop during breastfeeding. Infections can also be caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that usually exist quite harmlessly within the milk ducts (the tiny tubes inside the breast that carry milk). An overgrowth of bacteria can occur if stagnant milk collects in a blocked milk duct. When bacteria enter your body, your immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence) tries to fight them off by sending white blood cells to the affected area. The white blood cells attack the bacteria, which causes some of the tissue at the site of the infection to die, creating a small, hollow pocket. The pocket starts to fill with pus, forming an abscess. The pus contains a mixture of dead tissue, white blood cells and bacteria. As the infection progresses, the abscess may get bigger and more painful as more pus is produced.

This page covers: Symptoms When to see your GP Treatments Looking after your skin Cancer risk Actinic keratoses usually appear on skin that's exposed to the sun. Common places to get them are the: face forearms hands scalp ears lower legs The patches can be: red, pink, brown or skin-coloured rough or scaly (like sandpaper) flat or stick out from the skin (similar to warts) a few millimetres to a few centimetres across sore or itchy See your GP if you have: an unusual growth on your skin that you're worried about a patch or lump on your skin that gets bigger quickly, starts to hurt or bleeds had actinic keratoses before and think you may have a new patch It can be hard to tell if you have actinic keratoses. The patches can look similar to other conditions such as warts or skin cancer. Your GP can usually check if it's actinic keratoses by looking at your skin. They can refer you to a skin specialist if they're not sure. Talk to your GP about the treatment options for actinic keratoses. Sometimes they may just suggest that you check the patches regularly and come back if they start to grow quickly, hurt or bleed. If the patches cause problems (for example, they're unsightly or sore) or your doctor is concerned they could turn into cancer, they may suggest treatments such as: prescription creams and gels \u2013 including 5-fluorouracil cream, imiquimod cream, diclofenac gel (this isn't the same as the painkilling gel you can buy) and ingenol mebutate gel freezing the patches (cryotherapy) \u2013 this makes the patches turn into blisters and fall off after a few weeks scraping away the patches (curettage) with a sharp spoon-like instrument called a curette while your skin is numbed with local anaesthetic photodynamic therapy (PDT) \u2013 where special cream is applied to the patches and a light is shone onto them to kill the unusual cells; this usually involves using a lamp, but sometimes natural sunlight is used instead cutting out the patches with a scalpel while your skin is numbed with local anaesthetic The best treatment depends on how many patches you have, where they are and what they look like. Ask about the benefits and risks (such as side effects or scarring) of each option. If you have actinic keratoses, it's very important to protect your skin from the sun. This can reduce the risk of more patches appearing and may help reduce your risk of getting skin cancer. To protect yourself from the sun: cover your skin with clothes and a hat during the summer months apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 before going out into the sun try to stay inside or in the shade when the sun is at its strongest (between 11am and 3pm) Read more sun safety tips. It may also help to use moisturising creams (emollients) on your skin every day to stop it becoming dry. There's a small chance that actinic keratoses could eventually turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) if they're not treated. You're at a higher risk if you have lots of patches for a long time. Research suggests that people with several patches have around a 1 in 10 chance of getting skin cancer within 10 years of first developing actinic keratoses. Signs that a patch has turned into cancer include it: growing quickly hurting bleeding See your GP if you have these symptoms or if you get any new patches or lumps on your skin.

You won't be able to feel any pain after having a local anaesthetic, although you may still feel some pressure or movement. It normally only takes a few minutes to lose feeling in the area where a local anaesthetic is given. Full sensation should return a few hours later, when the medication has worn off. Local anaesthetics are usually given by dentists, surgeons, anaesthetists, GPs and other doctors. Some medications containing mild local anaesthetic are also available on prescription or over the counter from pharmacies. Depending on what they're being used for, local anaesthetics can be given as injections, creams, gels, sprays or ointments. Some of the main uses of local anaesthetics are outlined below. ","Preventing pain during and after surgery":"A local anaesthetic may be used along with a sedative medication to keep you relaxed while an operation or procedure is carried out. Local anaesthetics are mainly used for relatively minor procedures, such as: a filling or wisdom tooth removal a minor skin operation, such as the removal of moles, warts and verrucas some types of eye surgery, such as cataract removal a biopsy \u2013 where a sample of tissue is removed for closer examination under a microscope A local anaesthetic may occasionally be used for more major surgery when it's important for you to be awake, such as during certain types of brain surgery, or to prevent pain after a major operation carried out under a general anaesthetic (see below). ","Treating pain":"Slightly painful conditions such as mouth ulcers and sore throats can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter gels and sprays that contain a local anaesthetic. Injections of a local anaesthetic and steroid medication may be used to treat more severe conditions, such as long-term joint pain.  ","Epidural and spinal anaesthetics":"An epidural anaesthetic, often referred to as an epidural, is where a local anaesthetic is continually injected through a tube into an area of the lower back called the epidural space. A spinal anaesthetic is a single injection into a similar space in the back. Both types of anaesthetic can be used to numb large areas of the body by stopping pain signals travelling along the nerves in the spine. They're often used during childbirth to ease the pain of labour, or if a caesarean section is needed. They can also be used to reduce the amount of general anaesthesia needed during some operations and can provide pain relief afterwards. In some types of surgery, such as knee and hip replacements, they can be used in place of a general anaesthetic. ","Peripheral nerve blocks":"A nerve block is an injection of a local anaesthetic to numb the nerves supplying a particular part of the body, such as the hand, arm or leg. It may be used so that an operation can be carried out without needing a general anaesthetic, or to prevent pain afterwards. An ultrasound scan is often used to pinpoint the correct nerve. The injection shouldn't be painful and usually takes about 30 minutes to become fully effective. When peripheral nerve blocks and epidural or spinal anaesthetics are used in place of general anaesthetics, they are often combined with sedation to make you feel drowsy and more relaxed. Local anaesthetics are generally very safe and serious problems are rare. You may have some discomfort when the injection is given, a tingling sensation as the medication wears off, and possibly some minor bruising, bleeding or soreness where the injection was given, but you shouldn't experience any significant side effects. You should move carefully until the anaesthetic has worn off, as you may not notice if you injured yourself. Some people experience temporary side effects from a local anaesthetic, such as: dizziness headaches blurred vision twitching muscles continuing numbness, weakness or pins and needles These problems will usually pass, but you should tell the healthcare professional in charge of your care if you experience any. In very rare cases, you could have an allergic reaction to the local anaesthetic or develop serious problems such as seizures (fits) or a cardiac arrest (when the heart stops pumping blood around the body).

The various treatments for acne are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for acne, allowing you to compare your treatment options. If you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide. See your GP if your acne is more widespread, as you probably need prescription medication. For example, if: you have a large number of papules and pustules over-the-counter medication hasn't worked Prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include: topical retinoids topical antibiotics azelaic acid antibiotic tablets in women, the combined oral contraceptive pill isotretinoin tablets If you have severe acne, your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). For example, if you have: a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face painful nodules A combination of antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn't work, a medication called isotretinoin may be prescribed. Hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the progestogen-only pill or contraceptive implant can sometimes make acne worse. Many of these treatments can take two to three months before they start to work. It's important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if there's no immediate effect. ","Topical retinoids":"Topical retinoids work by removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating) which helps to prevent them building up within hair follicles. Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They're available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed. Apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face. It's important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV. Topical retinoids aren't suitable for use during pregnancy, as there's a risk they might cause birth defects. The most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin. A six-week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this. ","Azelaic acid":"Azelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful. Azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It's available as a cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive). The medication doesn't make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don't have to avoid exposure to the sun. You'll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves. The side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include: burning or stinging skin itchiness dry skin redness of the skin Antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne. In most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use. It usually takes about six weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne. Depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last four to six months. Tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment. You'll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time. Hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around periods or is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome. If you don't already use it, your GP may recommend the combined oral contraceptive pill, even if you're not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen. ","Isotretinoin and mood changes":"There have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There's no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication. However, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts. Several treatments for acne don't involve medication. These include: comedone extractor \u2013 a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads chemical peels \u2013 where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it photodynamic therapy \u2013 where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne However, these treatments may not work and can't be routinely recommended. ","Isotretinoin and birth defects":"Isotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you're a woman of childbearing age: don't use isotretinoin if you're pregnant or you think you're pregnant use one, or ideally two, methods of contraception for one month before treatment begins, during treatment and for one month after treatment has finished have a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment You'll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you're not currently sexually active. If you think you may have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately. Isotretinoin is also not suitable if you're breastfeeding. ","Acne and toothpaste":"A hint found on many websites is that toothpaste can dry up individual spots. While toothpaste does contain antibacterial substances, it also contains substances that can irritate and damage your skin. Using toothpaste in this way isn't recommended. There are far more effective and safer treatments available from pharmacists or your GP. Page last reviewed: 28/04/2016 Next review due: 28/12/2018 ","Topical antibiotics":"Topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They're available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day. A six- to eight-week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped, as there's a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections. Side effects are uncommon, but can include: minor irritation of the skin redness and burning of the skin peeling of the skin ","Co-cyprindiol":"Co-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne that doesn't respond to antibiotics. It helps to reduce the production of sebum. You'll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for two to six months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne. There's a small risk that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop breast cancer in later life. For example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven't taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least five years in their early twenties. There's also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk is estimated to be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year. It's not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin. Other side effects of co-cyprindiol include: bleeding and spotting between your periods, which can sometimes occur for the first few months headaches sore breasts mood changes loss of interest in sex weight gain or weight loss Isotretinoin has a number of beneficial effects: it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots However, the drug can also cause a wide range of side effects. It's only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven't responded to other treatments. Because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a dermatologist. Isotretinoin is taken as a tablet. Most people take a four- to six-month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles. Common side effects of isotretinoin include: inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils changes in your blood sugar levels inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis) blood in your urine Rarer side effects of isotretinoin include: inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) kidney disease Because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you'll need a blood test before and during treatment. ","Benzoyl peroxide":"Benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It's used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne. It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream. Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or clothes. Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include: dry and tense skin a burning, itching or stinging sensation some redness and peeling of the skin Side effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished. Most people need a six-week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning. ","URL":"/conditions/Acne"},"Introduction":{" ":"Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch. Acne most commonly develops on the: face \u2013 this affects almost everyone with acne back \u2013 this affects more than half of people with acne chest \u2013 this affects about 15% of people with acne There are six main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads \u2013 small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) whiteheads \u2013 have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won't empty when squeezed papules \u2013 small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules \u2013 similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules \u2013 large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful cysts \u2013 the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring The self-help techniques below may be useful: Don't wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse. Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse. Don't try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring. Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin). Completely remove make-up before going to bed. If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient. Regular exercise can't improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne. Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face. Although acne can't be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it's a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended \u2013 but be careful, as this can bleach clothing. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription. Even mild cases of acne can cause distress. If your acne is making you feel very unhappy or you can't control your spots with over-the-counter medication, see your GP. Also see your GP if you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. Treatments can take up to three months to work, so don't expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good. Read more about: diagnosing acne treating acne complications of acne Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn't help to remove this blockage. ","URL":"/conditions/Acne","Other possible causes":"Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. There's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne. Read more about the causes of acne, including some common acne myths. Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties. In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25. Page last reviewed: 28/04/2016 Next review due: 28/12/2018 "},"Complications":{" ":"Acne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. Any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it's more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin. Scarring can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it's important not to do this. There are three main types of acne scars: ice pick scars \u2013 small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object rolling scars \u2013 caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance boxcar scars \u2013 round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skin Treatments for acne scarring are regarded as a type of cosmetic surgery, which isn't usually available on the NHS. However, in the past, exceptions have been made when it's been shown that acne scarring has caused serious psychological distress. See your GP if you're considering having cosmetic surgery. They'll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the NHS. Many private clinics offer treatment for acne scarring. Prices can vary widely (from £500 to more than £10,000) depending on the type of treatment needed. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons website has more information about private treatment available in your area. It's important to have realistic expectations about what cosmetic treatment can achieve. While treatment can certainly improve the appearance of your scars, it can't get rid of them completely. After treatment for acne scarring, most people notice a 50-75% improvement in their appearance. Some of the available treatments for acne scarring are explained below. ","Subcision":"Subcision is a surgical treatment that can be used to treat rolling scars. During surgery, the upper layer of the skin is removed from the underlying scar tissue. This allows blood to pool under the affected area. The blood clot helps form connective tissue, which pushes up the rolling scar so it's level with the rest of the surface of the skin. Once subscision has been completed, additional treatment, such as laser treatment and dermabrasion, can be used to further improve the appearance of the scar. Acne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. This combination of factors can lead to people with acne becoming depressed. You may be depressed if during the last month you've often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things. If you think that you or your child may have depression, it's important to speak to your GP. Treatments for depression include: talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Read more about treatment for depression. There's currently no main charity or support group for people affected by acne in England. However, there's a range of informally run message boards and blogs about acne on the web. You may find it supportive to read about other people's experience of living with acne. For example, talkhealth provides a free acne support and information community. The Mix (formerly Get Connected) also has a website and helpline for teenagers and young people with emotional and other difficulties.  ","Make-up":"Make-up can help cover up scars and can be particularly useful for facial scars. Camouflage make-up specially designed to cover up scars is available over the counter at pharmacies. You can also ask your GP for advice. If you're interested in learning more about covering a mark, scar, non-infectious skin condition or a tattoo, you can also visit the Changing Faces skin camouflage service or call 0300 012 0276. Page last reviewed: 28/04/2016 Next review due: 28/12/2018 ","Dermabrasion":"Dermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin, either using lasers or a specially made wire brush. After the procedure, your skin will look red and sore for several months, but as it heals you should notice an improvement in the appearance of your scars. ","Laser treatment":"Laser treatment can be used to treat mild to moderate acne scarring. There are two types of laser treatment: ablative laser treatment \u2013 where lasers are used to remove a small patch of skin around the scar to produce a new, smooth-looking area of skin non-ablative laser treatment \u2013 where lasers are used to stimulate the growth of new collagen (a type of protein found in skin), which helps to repair some of the damage caused by scarring, and improves the appearance ","URL":"/conditions/Acne","Punch techniques":"Punch techniques are used to treat ice pick scars and boxcar scars. There are three types of punch technique: punch excision \u2013 used to treat mild ice pick scars. The scar is surgically removed and the remaining wound is sealed. After the wound heals, it leaves a smoother and more even area of skin. punch elevation \u2013 used to treat boxcar scars. The base of the scar is surgically removed, leaving the sides of the scar in place. The base is then reattached to the sides, but lifted up so it's level with the surface of the skin. This makes the scar much less noticeable. punch grafting \u2013 used to treat very deep ice pick scars. As with a punch excision, the scar is removed, but the wound is \"plugged\" with a sample of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (usually from the back of the ear). "},"Causes":{" ":"Acne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked. Sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of. Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum. In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle. If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead. Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts. Teenage acne is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls. The sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones. It's thought that increased levels of testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs. Acne can run in families. If your parents had acne, it's likely that you'll also develop it. One study has found that if both your parents had acne, you're more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you're more likely to get adult acne too. More than 80% of cases of adult acne occur in women. It's thought that many cases of adult acne are caused by the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times. These times include: periods \u2013 some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period pregnancy \u2013 many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first three months of their pregnancy polycystic ovary syndrome \u2013 a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary Other possible triggers of an acne flare-up include: some cosmetic products \u2013 however, this is less common as most products are now tested, so they don't cause spots (non-comedogenic) certain medications \u2013 such as steroid medications, lithium (used to treat depression and bipolar disorder) and some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat epilepsy) regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as a headband or backpack smoking \u2013 which can contribute to acne in older people Despite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood. There are many myths and misconceptions about it: ","\"Acne is caused by a poor diet\"":"So far, research hasn't found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it's good for your heart and your health in general. ","\"Acne is infectious\"":"You can't pass acne on to other people.

This involves examining your face, chest and back for the different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules. How many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is important in planning your treatment. Four grades can be used to measure the severity of acne: grade 1 (mild) \u2013 acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules grade 2 (moderate) \u2013 there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face grade 3 (moderately severe) \u2013 there's a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne grade 4 (severe) \u2013 there's a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules If acne suddenly starts in adult women, it can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as: excessive body hair (hirsutism) irregular or light periods The most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

This means practising good dental hygiene is the best way to prevent actinomycosis. Read about preventing tooth decay and dental health for more information and advice about good oral hygiene practices. ","Treating actinomycosis":"Actinomycosis usually responds well to treatment, which involves taking a long-term course of antibiotics. An initial course of antibiotic injections is usually recommended for 2 to 6 weeks, followed by antibiotic tablets for another 6 to 12 months. A nurse should be able to teach you how to administer antibiotic injections at home so you don't need to stay in hospital for the duration of the course. The preferred antibiotics for treating actinomycosis are benzylpenicillin, which is used for the antibiotic injections, and amoxicillin tablets. In some cases, other bacteria are also present and more than one antibiotic or other antibiotics will need to be given. Side effects of these antibiotics include: diarrhoea  nausea (feeling sick) skin rash increased vulnerability to fungal infections, such as oral thrush (a fungal infection that occurs in the mouth) If you're allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin can be used. Read more about antibiotics. In some cases, minor surgery may be required to repair the damaged tissue and drain pus out of the abscesses. ","Introduction ":"Actinomycosis is a rare type of bacterial infection caused by a group of bacteria called actinomycetaceae. Most bacterial infections are confined to one part of the body because the bacteria are unable to penetrate the body's tissue. However, actinomycosis is unusual in that the infection is able to move slowly but steadily through body tissue. Symptoms of actinomycosis vary depending on the type of infection, but can include: swelling and inflammation of affected tissue tissue damage that results in scar tissue formation of abscesses (pus-filled swellings) small holes or tunnels that develop in tissue and leak a type of lumpy pus Read more about the symptoms of actinomycosis. ","Types of actinomycosis":"In theory, actinomycosis can develop almost anywhere inside the tissue of the human body. But the condition tends to affect certain areas of the body and can be classified into four main types. They are: oral cervicofacial actinomycosis thoracic actinomycosis abdominal actinomycosis pelvic actinomycosis These are described below. Oral cervicofacial actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the neck, jaw or mouth. In the past, if the condition developed in the jaw it was known as lumpy jaw. Most cases of oral cervicofacial actinomycosis are caused by dental problems, such as tooth decay or a jaw injury. Oral cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common type of actinomycosis, accounting for 50-70% of all cases. Thoracic actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the lungs or associated airways. Most cases of thoracic actinomycosis are thought to be caused by people accidentally inhaling droplets of contaminated fluid into their lungs. Thoracic actinomycosis accounts for an estimated 15-20% of cases. Abdominal actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the abdomen (tummy). This type of actinomycosis can have a range of potential causes. It can develop as a secondary complication of a more common infection, such as appendicitis, or after accidentally swallowing a foreign object, such as a chicken bone. Abdominal actinomycosis accounts for an estimated 20% of all cases. Pelvic actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the pelvis. It usually only occurs in women because most cases are caused when the actinomyces bacteria are spread from the female genitals into the pelvis. Most cases of pelvic actinomycosis are thought to be associated with the long-term use of an intrauterine device (IUD). This type of contraceptive is often known as the coil. Pelvic actinomycosis usually only occurs if the coil is left in for longer than the manufacturer recommends. Pelvic actinomycosis accounts for an estimated 10% of all cases. ","Who's affected by actinomycosis?":"Actinomycosis is one of the rarest types of bacterial infections. In developed countries, such as England, it's thought just 1 in 300,000 people will develop actinomycosis in any given year. On average, there are 100 admissions to hospital each year in England because of actinomycosis.

In most cases, the bacteria live harmlessly on the lining of the mouth, throat, digestive system and vagina (in women). The bacteria only pose a problem if the tissue lining becomes damaged by injury or disease, allowing the bacteria to penetrate deeper into the body. This is potentially serious because these are anaerobic bacteria, which means they thrive in parts of the body where there isn't much oxygen, such as deep inside body tissues. However, an advantage of actinomyces bacteria being anaerobic is that they can't survive outside the human body. This means that actinomycosis isn't a contagious condition. Read more about the causes of actinomycosis. ","URL":"/conditions/Actinomycosis","Diagnosing actinomycosis":"In its initial stages, actinomycosis can be a challenging condition to diagnose correctly because it shares symptoms with other more common conditions. It's often only discovered during tests or surgery to check for other conditions. For example, many cases of actinomycosis are detected when biopsies are carried out to check for cancer. A biopsy is where a small tissue sample is removed so it can be examined under a microscope. Actinomycosis can usually be more confidently diagnosed in its later stages, after the sinus tracts have appeared in the surface of the skin. This is because the sulphur granules produced by the sinus tracts during an actinomycosis infection have a distinctive shape that can be identified under a microscope. ","Complications of actinomycosis":"Abscesses that develop as a result of actinomycosis may form in many parts of your body, including your lungs. They can spread easily from one part of your body to another. If the original site of the infection is located in the skin of your face, it may spread to nearby parts of your body, such as your scalp or ears. If the original site of the infection is your mouth, it may spread to your tongue, larynx (voicebox), trachea (windpipe) and salivary glands, and the tubes that connect your throat to your nose. If the infection spreads to your brain, a brain abscess could develop. "},"Causes":{"How actinomycosis spreads":"Actinomycetaceae are anaerobic bacteria, which means they can't survive in oxygen-rich environments. They therefore don't cause illness when they're in the mouth or intestinal tract. However, if the bacteria break through the protective lining (mucous membrane) surrounding the cavities, they can penetrate deep into body tissue. As the deep layers of human tissue are low in oxygen, the bacteria are able to reproduce quickly and infect healthy tissue. In an attempt to combat the infection, your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) will send infection-fighting cells to the source of the infection. But these cells are unable to kill the bacteria and will quickly die. As the infection-fighting cells die, they accumulate into a yellowish-coloured liquid (pus). Having failed to kill the infection, your immune system will attempt to limit its spread by using healthy tissue to form a protective barrier around the pus. This is how an abscess (pus-filled swelling) develops. Actinomycetaceae are able to penetrate the protective barrier of an abscess and move into more healthy tissue. Your immune system will attempt to counter the infection by producing more abscesses. Your body will eventually need to get rid of the accumulation of pus. To do this, small channels called sinus tracts will develop that lead from the abscesses to the surface of your skin. The sinus tracts will leak pus, as well as lumps of bacteria. This takes the form of a yellow powdery substance sometimes referred to as \"sulphur granules\". ","Opportunistic infection":"Actinomycosis is an opportunistic infection that doesn't cause symptoms unless the chance arises for it to penetrate body tissue. Opportunities for oral cervicofacial actinomycosis include: tooth decay, particularly if the decay is left untreated for years gum disease  dental abscess  tonsillitis  middle ear infection (otitis media) dental surgery, such as a tooth extraction, or root canal treatment jaw surgery or trauma Most cases of thoracic actinomycosis are thought to be caused by small food particles or other ingested material that gets mixed up with the actinomycosis bacteria. Rather than passing harmlessly down into the stomach, the particles are mistakenly passed down into the windpipe and the airways of the lungs. People with long-term drug or alcohol problems are particularly at risk of developing thoracic actinomycosis. This is because being drunk or intoxicated increases the risk of material being accidentally ingested into your lungs. Long-term alcohol misuse and drug misuse also weakens your immune system, making you more vulnerable to developing an infection. Abdominal actinomycosis occurs when something tears the wall of the intestine (bowel), allowing the bacteria to penetrate into deep tissue. The intestine can tear as the result of an infection, such as a burst appendix that damages the intestine wall. It can also be damaged through injury \u2013 for example, if you were to mistakenly swallow a fish bone. There have also been some reported cases of abdominal actinomycosis occurring as a complication of bowel or abdominal surgery. Most cases of pelvic actinomycosis have been recorded in women who were using an intrauterine device (IUD) form of contraception. An IUD is a small, T-shaped contraceptive device made from plastic and copper that fits inside the womb. The women affected by the condition tend to be long-term users of an IUD (eight years or more). One explanation for cases of pelvic actinomycosis in women who are using an IUD is that, over time, it may damage the womb lining, allowing bacteria to penetrate deep tissue. However, no research has been carried out to find out whether or not this is the case. It's important to note that it's very rare to develop pelvic actinomycosis as a result of using an IUD. For example, in England, millions of women use the device and there have only been a handful of reported cases of pelvic actinomycosis. It only tends to occur if an IUD is left in place longer than the manufacturer recommends.

Some of the main causes of angioedema are outlined below. Angioedema is often the result of an allergic reaction. This is where the body mistakes a harmless substance, such as a certain food, for something dangerous. It releases chemicals into the body to attack the substance, which cause the skin to swell. Angioedema can be triggered by an allergic reaction to: certain types of food \u2013 particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs some types of medication \u2013 including some antibiotics, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen insect bites and stings \u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings latex \u2013 a type of rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and condoms Angioedema caused by allergies is known as \"allergic angioedema\". Some medicines can cause angioedema \u2013 even if you're not allergic to the medication. The swelling may occur soon after you start taking a new medication, or possibly months or even years later. Medications that can cause angioedema include: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril, which are used to treat high blood pressure  ibuprofen and other types of NSAID painkillers  angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), such as andesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan \u2013 another medication used to treat high blood pressure Angioedema caused by medication is known as \"drug-induced angioedema\". Rarely, angioedema occurs because of a genetic fault that you inherit from your parents. The fault affects the gene responsible for the production of a substance called C1 esterase inhibitor. If you don't have enough of this, the immune system can occasionally \"misfire\" and cause angioedema. The swelling may happen randomly, or it may be triggered by: an injury or infection surgery and dental treatment stress pregnancy certain medications, such as the contraceptive pill How often the swelling occurs can vary. Some people experience it every week, while in others it may occur less than once a year. Angioedema caused by a genetic fault is known as \"hereditary angioedema\". If you have it, you have a 50% chance of passing it on to your children. In many cases, it's not clear what causes angioedema. One theory is that an unknown problem with the immune system might cause it to occasionally misfire. Certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as: anxiety or stress minor infections hot or cold temperatures strenuous exercise In very rare cases, the swelling may be associated with other medical conditions, such as lupus or lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system).

There are several different causes of angioedema. It's important to know what's causing your symptoms, as this affects the treatment you'll need. There's no single test to determine the cause of angioedema. Some of the checks and tests you may have are outlined below. Your doctor may be able to get a good idea of the cause of your angioedema by asking about your symptoms and medical history. For example: it's likely to have been caused by an allergy if you were exposed to something that can trigger allergic reactions (an allergen) soon before it started, or if you also developed a raised, itchy rash (urticaria or hives) it may have been triggered by a medication if you're currently taking a medicine that's associated with angioedema, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure it's possible your symptoms are a result of an inherited genetic fault if you have a family history of angioedema Sometimes the tests below may be needed to confirm the cause. If your doctor thinks your symptoms may have been caused by an allergy, they may refer you to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. Tests you may have include: a skin prick test \u2013 your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there's a reaction a blood test \u2013 a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergen These tests can help determine what you're allergic to. Read more about allergy testing. If your doctor thinks your symptoms may be caused by a genetic fault you've inherited from your parents, they may refer you for a blood test. The test checks the level of a substance called C1 esterase inhibitor in your blood. This substance is important in regulating the immune system.

It may be possible for you to be treated by your GP or you may be referred to a heart specialist (a cardiologist). Some cardiologists, known as electrophysiologists, specialise in the management of abnormalities of heart rhythm. You'll have a treatment plan and work closely with your healthcare team to decide the most suitable and appropriate treatment for you. Factors that will be taken into consideration include: your age you overall health the type of atrial fibrillation you have  your symptoms whether you have an underlying cause that needs to be treated The first step is to try to find the cause of the atrial fibrillation. If a cause can be identified, you may only need treatment for this. For example, if you have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), medication to treat it may also cure atrial fibrillation. If no underlying cause can be found, the treatment options are: medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke medicines to control atrial fibrillation cardioversion (electric shock treatment) catheter ablation having a pacemaker fitted You'll be promptly referred to your specialist treatment team if one type of treatment fails to control your symptoms of atrial fibrillation and more specialised management is needed. Medicines called anti-arrhythmics can control atrial fibrillation by: restoring a normal heart rhythm controlling the rate at which the heart beats The choice of anti-arrhythmic medicine depends on the type of atrial fibrillation, any other medical conditions you have, side effects of the medicine chosen and how well the atrial fibrillation responds. Some people with atrial fibrillation may need more than one anti-arrhythmic medicine to control it. A variety of medicines are available to restore normal heart rhythm, including: flecainide  beta-blockers, particularly sotalol amiodarone  dronedarone (only for certain people) An alternative medication may be recommended if a particular medicine doesn't work or the side effects are troublesome. Newer medicines are in development, but aren't widely available yet. The aim is to reduce the resting heart rate to under 90 beats per minute, although in some people the target is under 110 beats per minute. A beta-blocker, such as bisoprolol or atenolol, or a calcium channel blocker, such as verapamil or diltiazem, will be prescribed. A medicine called digoxin may be added to help control the heart rate further. In some cases, amiodarone may be tried. Normally, only one medication will be tried before catheter ablation (see below) is considered. ","Side effects":"As with any medicine, anti-arrhythmics can cause side effects. The most common side effects of anti-arrhythmics are: beta-blockers \u2013 tiredness, coldness of hands and feet, low blood pressure, nightmares and impotence flecainide \u2013 nausea, vomiting and heart rhythm disorders amiodarone \u2013 sensitivity to sunlight (high-protection sunscreen must be worn or skin covered up), lung problems, changes to liver function or thyroid function (regular blood tests can check for this) and deposits in the eye (these disappear when treatment is stopped) verapamil \u2013 constipation, low blood pressure, ankle swelling and heart failure Read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine for more details. The way the heart beats in atrial fibrillation means there's a risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers. If these enter the bloodstream, they can cause a stroke (see complications of atrial fibrillation for more information). Your doctor will assess your risk and try to minimise your chance of having a stroke. They'll consider your age and whether you have a history of any of the following: stroke or blood clots heart valve problems heart failure  high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes  heart disease  You may be given medication according to your risk of having a stroke. Depending on your level of risk, you may be prescribed warfarin or a newer type of anticoagulant, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban (see below). If you're prescribed an anticoagulant, your risk of bleeding will be assessed both before you start the medication and while you're taking it. Aspirin isn't recommended to prevent strokes caused by atrial fibrillation. ","Warfarin":"People with atrial fibrillation who have a high or moderate risk of having a stroke are usually prescribed warfarin, unless there's a reason they can't take it. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, which means it stops the blood clotting. There's an increased risk of bleeding in people who take warfarin, but this small risk is usually outweighed by the benefits of preventing a stroke. It's important to take warfarin as directed by your doctor. If you're prescribed warfarin, you need to have regular blood tests and, after these, your dose may be changed. Many medicines can interact with warfarin and cause serious problems, so check that any new medicines you're prescribed are safe to take with warfarin. While taking warfarin, you should be careful about drinking too much alcohol regularly and avoid binge drinking. Drinking cranberry juice and grapefruit juice can also interact with warfarin and isn't recommended. ","Alternative anticoagulants":"Rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban and edoxaban are newer anticoagulants and an alternative to warfarin. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has approved these medicines for use in treating atrial fibrillation. NICE also states that you should be offered a choice of anticoagulation and the opportunity to discuss the merits of each medicine. Unlike warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban and edoxaban don't interact with other medicines and don't require regular blood tests. In large trials, the medicines have been shown to be as effective or more effective than warfarin at preventing strokes and deaths. They also have a similar or lower rate of major bleeding. You can read more about rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban in the NICE guidance about Atrial fibrillation: management. Edoxaban is recommended as an option for preventing stroke, heart disease and coronary artery disease in people with atrial fibrillation who have one or more risk factors, such as: heart failure, high blood pressure or diabetes a previous history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) aged 75 years or older You can read the NICE guidance about Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Cardioversion may be recommended for some people with atrial fibrillation. It involves giving the heart a controlled electric shock to try to restore a normal rhythm. Cardioversion is usually carried out in hospital so that the heart can be carefully monitored. If you've had atrial fibrillation for more than two days, cardioversion can increase the risk of a clot forming. In this case, you'll be given an anticoagulant for three to four weeks before cardioversion, and for at least four weeks afterwards to minimise the chance of having a stroke. In an emergency, pictures of the heart can be taken to check for blood clots, and cardioversion can be carried out without going on medication first. Anticoagulation may be stopped if cardioversion is successful. However, you may need to continue taking anticoagulation after cardioversion if the risk of atrial fibrillation returning is high and you have an increased risk of having a stroke (see above). Catheter ablation is a procedure that very carefully destroys the diseased area of your heart and interrupts abnormal electrical circuits. It's an option if medication hasn't been effective or tolerated. Catheters (thin, soft wires) are guided through one of your veins into your heart, where they record electrical activity. When the source of the abnormality is found, an energy source, such as high-frequency radiowaves that generate heat, is transmitted through one of the catheters to destroy the tissue. The procedure usually takes two to three hours, so it may be carried out under general anaesthetic (which means you're asleep during the procedure). You should make a quick recovery after having catheter ablation and be able to carry out most of your normal activities the next day. However, you shouldn't lift anything heavy for two weeks, and driving should be avoided for the first two days. A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device that's implanted in your chest, just below your collarbone. It's usually used to stop your heart beating too slowly, but in atrial fibrillation it may be used to help your heart beat regularly. Having a pacemaker fitted is usually a minor surgical procedure carried out under a local anaesthetic (the area being operated on is numbed and you are awake during the procedure). This treatment may be used when medicines aren't effective or are unsuitable. This tends to be in people aged 80 or over. Read more about pacemaker implantation.

","Introduction ":"Atrial fibrillation is a heart condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate. A normal heart rate should be regular and between 60 and 100 beats a minute when you're resting. You can measure your heart rate by feeling the pulse in your neck or wrist. In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate is irregular and can sometimes be very fast. In some cases, it can be considerably higher than 100 beats a minute. This can cause problems including dizziness, shortness of breath and tiredness. You may be aware of noticeable heart palpitations, where your heart feels like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for a few seconds or, in some cases, a few minutes.    Sometimes, atrial fibrillation doesn't cause any symptoms and a person with it is completely unaware that their heart rate isn't regular. Read more about the symptoms of atrial fibrillation. ","What causes atrial fibrillation?":"When the heart beats normally, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, so the heart can fill with blood again. This process is repeated every time the heart beats. In atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) contract randomly and sometimes so fast that the heart muscle can't relax properly between contractions. This reduces the heart's efficiency and performance. Atrial fibrillation occurs when abnormal electrical impulses suddenly start firing in the atria. These impulses override the heart's natural pacemaker, which can no longer control the rhythm of the heart. This causes you to have a highly irregular pulse rate. The cause isn't fully understood, but it tends to occur in certain groups of people (see below) and may be triggered by certain situations, such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or smoking. Read more about the causes of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can be defined in various ways, depending on the degree to which it affects you. For example: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation \u2013 episodes come and go, and usually stop within 48 hours without any treatment persistent atrial fibrillation \u2013 each episode lasts for longer than seven days (or less when it's treated) long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation \u2013 this means you have had continuous atrial fibrillation for a year or longer permanent atrial fibrillation \u2013 atrial fibrillation is present all the time  ","Treating atrial fibrillation":"Atrial fibrillation isn't usually life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and often requires treatment. Treatment may involve:  medication to prevent a stroke (people with atrial fibrillation are more at risk of having a stroke) medication to control the heart rate or rhythm cardioversion \u2013 where the heart is given a controlled electric shock to restore normal rhythm catheter ablation \u2013 where the area inside the heart that's causing the abnormal heart rhythm is destroyed using radiofrequency energy; you may then need to have a pacemaker fitted to help your heart beat regularly Read more about treating atrial fibrillation and the possible complications of atrial fibrillation. ","Who's affected?":"Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance, affecting around one million people in the UK. Atrial fibrillation can affect adults of any age, but it becomes more common as you get older. It affects about 7 in 100 people aged over 65, and more men than women have it.  Atrial fibrillation is more likely to occur in people with other conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), atherosclerosis, or a heart valve problem. ","Information about you":"If you have atrial fibrillation, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. ","URL":"/conditions/Atrial-fibrillation","Atrial flutter":"Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation, but shares the same symptoms, causes and possible complications. Around a third of people with atrial flutter also have atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in the atria is more organised and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns caused by atrial fibrillation. Treatment for atrial flutter is also slightly different, because catheter ablation (see above) is considered to be the best treatment, whereas medication is often the first treatment used for atrial fibrillation.

When the upper chambers of the heart (atria) don't pump efficiently, as in atrial fibrillation, there's a risk of blood clots forming. These blood clots may move into the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles), and get pumped into the blood supply to the lungs or the general blood circulation. Clots in the general circulation can block arteries in the brain, causing a stroke. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of a stroke by around four to five times. However, the risk depends on a number of factors, including age and whether you have high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, diabetes and a previous history of blood clots. If your atrial fibrillation is persistent, it may start to weaken your heart. In extreme cases, it can lead to heart failure, as your heart is unable to pump blood around your body efficiently.

Atrial fibrillation is common in people with other heart conditions, such as: high blood pressure (hypertension) atherosclerosis heart valve disease congenital heart disease cardiomyopathy  pericarditis It's also associated with other medical conditions, including: an overactive thyroid gland pneumonia asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lung cancer diabetes pulmonary embolism  carbon monoxide poisoning However, not everyone with atrial fibrillation has one of the conditions above. It can sometimes affect people who are physically very fit, such as athletes. When no other conditions are associated with atrial fibrillation, it's known as lone atrial fibrillation. Certain situations can trigger an episode of atrial fibrillation, including: drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, particularly binge drinking being overweight (read about how to lose weight) drinking lots of caffeine, such as tea, coffee or energy drinks taking illegal drugs, particularly amphetamines or cocaine smoking  Page last reviewed: 18/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Atrial-fibrillation"},"Title":"Atrial fibrillation","Diagnosis":{" ":"See your GP immediately if you have chest pain and notice a sudden change in your heartbeat. Follow the four steps below to check your pulse. sit down for five minutes and avoid smoking or drinking caffeine before taking the reading hold your left hand out with your palm facing up and elbow slightly bent firmly place the index and middle finger of your right hand on your left wrist, at the base of the thumb (between the wrist and the tendon attached to the thumb) using the second hand on a clock or watch, count the number of beats for 30 seconds, and then double that number to get your heart rate in beats per minute At rest, a normal heart rate should be 60 to 100 beats per minute. In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate can often be considerably higher than 100 beats per minute and each individual beat is erratic. Heart rhythm charity Arrythmia Alliance has further information on knowing your pulse and how to check it (PDF, 113kb). Checking and assessing your pulse can give you a good indication of whether you have atrial fibrillation, but a full medical investigation will be needed before a diagnosis can be made. Make an appointment to see your GP if: you notice a sudden change in your heartbeat your heart rate is consistently lower than 60 or above 100 (particularly if you're experiencing other symptoms of atrial fibrillation) See your GP as soon as possible if you have chest pain. If atrial fibrillation is suspected, your GP may give you an electrocardiogram (ECG) and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) for further tests. A cardiologist who specialises in electrical disturbances of the heart is known as an electrophysiologist. They can carry out a procedure called catheter ablation to treat your atrial fibrillation. An ECG is a test that records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. It's usually carried out in a hospital or GP surgery, takes about five minutes and is painless.  During an ECG, small stickers, called electrodes, are attached to your arms, legs and chest, and connected by wires to an ECG machine. Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals. An ECG machine traces these signals onto paper. During an episode of atrial fibrillation, your heart rate will be irregular and over 100 beats per minute. If you have an episode of atrial fibrillation during an ECG, your abnormal heart rate will be recorded. This will confirm the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and rule out other conditions. However, as it can often be difficult to capture an episode of atrial fibrillation, you may be asked to wear a small, portable ECG recorder. The recorder will either trace your heart rate continuously over 24 hours, or when you switch it on at the start of an episode. According to guidance produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), if you have atrial fibrillation, a number of other tests should be carried out. These include: an echocardiogram \u2013 which is an ultrasound scan of the heart; it can help to identify any other heart-related problems, and is used to assess the structure and function of the heart and valves a chest X-ray \u2013 which can help to identify any lung problems that may be causing atrial fibrillation blood tests \u2013 which can highlight anaemia, problems with kidney function, or an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) Page last reviewed: 18/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Atrial-fibrillation"},"Symptoms":{" ":"Some people with atrial fibrillation, particularly older people, don't have any symptoms. The abnormality in heart rhythm is often only discovered during routine tests or investigations for another condition. Typically, a cardioversion (where the heart is given a controlled electric shock to restore normal rhythm) is carried out. At this point, many people feel much better and realise that they hadn't been feeling normal. People often attribute tiredness and feeling lethargic to ageing, but once normal rhythm is restored, they realise that these symptoms were caused by atrial fibrillation. The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is heart palpitations \u2013 where your heart may feel like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for a few seconds or possibly a few minutes. As well as an irregular heartbeat, your heart may also beat very fast (often considerably higher than 100 beats per minute). You can work out your heart rate by checking the pulse in your neck or wrist. Other symptoms you may experience if you have atrial fibrillation include: tiredness, and being less able to exercise breathlessness  feeling faint or lightheaded chest pain The way the heart beats in atrial fibrillation reduces the heart's performance and efficiency. This can lead to low blood pressure (hypotension) and heart failure. You should see your GP immediately if you notice a sudden change in your heartbeat and experience chest pain. It's only possible to confirm a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after you've had an electrocardiogram (ECG). This is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart.

AAAs are grouped into three sizes: small AAA \u2013 3cm to 4.4cm across medium AAA \u2013 4.5cm to 5.4cm across large AAA \u2013 5.5cm or more across Large AAAs are more likely to burst (rupture), so surgery to stop this happening is usually recommended. The risk of a small or medium AAA bursting is much lower, so you'll normally be advised to have regular scans to check its size and to make healthy lifestyle changes to help stop it getting bigger. Ask your doctor if you're not sure what size your aneurysm is. You might not need treatment if you have a small or medium AAA. This is because the risk of the AAA bursting is smaller than the risk of complications of surgery. You'll be asked to come back for regular ultrasound scans to check if your aneurysm is getting bigger. Scans are done: every year if you have a small AAA every three months if you have a medium AAA Surgery may be offered if your aneurysm becomes a large AAA. You'll also be told about lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of an aneurysm getting bigger, such as eating healthily. Read more about how to stop an aneurysm growing. You can otherwise carry on as normal, although having an AAA may have some implications for things such as driving and getting travel insurance. Read some frequently asked questions about AAAs for more information. If you have a large AAA, surgery to strengthen it with a piece of man-made tubing (a graft) is usually recommended because the risk of it bursting is bigger than the risk of surgery complications. There are two main types of surgery for an AAA: endovascular surgery \u2013 the graft is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin and then carefully passed up into the aorta open surgery \u2013 the graft is placed in the aorta through a cut in your tummy Both techniques are equally good at reducing the risk of an AAA bursting, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Talk to your surgeon about which is best for you. If surgery isn't suitable for you, you'll have regular scans to monitor your aneurysm and be given advice about healthy lifestyle changes, and you may be prescribed medication to help stop the aneurysm bursting. ","Open surgery":"During open surgery, a cut is made in your tummy and your surgeon replaces the affected section of aorta with a graft. This is done under general anaesthetic. You'll usually stay in hospital for 7-10 days after the operation, and it'll take a few weeks or months to fully recover. The risk of complications is generally higher than with endovascular surgery, and the hospital stay and recovery time is often longer. Around 95-97% of people make a full recovery. Risks of open surgery include: a wound infection or infection of the graft a blood clot heavy bleeding from your groin a heart attack or stroke in men, erectile dysfunction or ejaculation problems The risk of graft problems is lower than with endovascular surgery. The graft will usually work well for the rest of your life and you won't normally need regular scans to check it. Watch a video about open surgery for an AAA. A burst aneurysm is treated with emergency surgery using the same techniques used for a large aneurysm. The decision about whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made by the surgeon carrying out the operation. Only about 2 in 10 people who have a burst aneurysm survive, which is why an operation to stop an aneurysm bursting is usually recommended if it's large. ","Endovascular surgery":"In endovascular surgery, a graft is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin through small cuts made in your skin. It's then carefully guided up into the aneurysm. This is usually done under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. You'll normally stay in hospital for two or three days after the operation, and it'll take a few weeks or months to fully recover. The risk of complications is generally lower than with open surgery, and the hospital stay and recovery time is often shorter. Around 98% of people make a full recovery. Risks of endovascular surgery include: the graft leaking or slipping out of position \u2013 you'll have regular scans to check for this, and you may need another operation to fix any problems a wound infection or infection of the graft heavy bleeding from your groin a blood clot, heart attack or stroke Watch a video about endovascular surgery for an AAA.

As they wait for surgery, they may need to: stop having milk feeds and instead be given fluids directly into a vein have a tube passed through their nose and into their stomach to drain away any fluid and air collecting in it have regular bowel washouts, where a thin tube is inserted into their bottom and warm salt water is used to soften and flush out the trapped stools take antibiotics if they have enterocolitis Your child may need to stay in hospital during this time, or you may be able to look after them at home. Your doctor will advise you about this. Most children will have the \"pull-through\" operation, where the affected section of bowel is removed and the remaining healthy sections of bowel are joined together. This will usually be done when they're around three months old. If your child isn't well enough to have this procedure \u2013 for example, because they have enterocolitis or a severe blockage \u2013 they may have it in two stages. A few days after birth, the surgeon will divert the bowel through a temporary opening (stoma) made in the tummy. This procedure is called a colostomy formation. Stools will pass directly out of the opening into a pouch worn on your child's body until they're well enough to have another procedure to remove the affected section of bowel, close the opening, and join the healthy sections of bowel together. This is usually done at around three months of age. These procedures can be done using either: laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery \u2013 this involves inserting surgical instruments through tiny cuts  open surgery \u2013 where a larger cut is made in your child's tummy Speak to your surgeon about the best option for your child. No surgery is risk-free.

They'll be given pain-relieving medicine to make them comfortable and fluids into a vein until they can manage food. No special diet is needed once you get home, but it's important they drink plenty of fluids as they recover.  Your child should recover well and their bowels should function normally after surgery. At first they'll probably have a sore bottom when they poo. It can help to leave their bottom open to the air whenever possible, and use baby oil to gently clean their bottom as well as nappy cream after each change. Call your doctor immediately if your child develops problems such as a swollen belly, fever, or foul-smelling diarrhoea.

Page last reviewed: 10/03/2016 Next review due: 01/03/2019 ","Introduction ":"Hirschsprung's disease is a rare condition that causes poo to become stuck in the bowels. It mainly affects babies and young children. Normally, the bowel continuously squeezes and relaxes to push poo along, a process controlled by your nervous system. In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerves that control this movement are missing from a section at the end of the bowel, which means poo can build up and form a blockage. This can cause severe constipation, and occasionally lead to a serious bowel infection called enterocolitis if it's not identified and treated early on. However, the condition is usually picked up soon after birth and treated with surgery as soon as possible. This page covers: Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease When to get medical advice How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed What causes Hirschsprung's disease? Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease ","What causes Hirschsprung's disease?":"The muscles of the bowel are controlled by nerve cells called ganglion cells. In Hirschsprung's disease, these ganglion cells are missing from a section at the end of bowel, extending up from the anus, the opening in the bottom that poo passes through. For some reason, the cells didn't develop in that area when the baby was growing in the womb. It's not clear why this happens, but it's not thought to be caused by anything the mother did while she was pregnant. A number of genes are associated with Hirschsprung's disease and it does sometimes run in families. If you've had a child with it before, you're more likely to have another child with it. The condition is occasionally part of a wider genetic condition, such as Down's syndrome, but most cases aren't. ","Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease":"Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease are usually noticeable from soon after a baby is born, although occasionally they're not obvious until a child is a year or two old. Signs of the condition in a baby include: failing to pass meconium within 48 hours \u2013 the dark, tar-like poo that healthy babies pass soon after being born a swollen belly vomiting green fluid (bile) Signs in older infants and children include: a swollen belly and a tummy ache persistent constipation that doesn't get better with the usual treatments not feeding well or gaining much weight If your child develops a bowel infection (enterocolitis), they may also have a high temperature (fever) and watery, foul-smelling diarrhoea. ","Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease":"Most children are able to pass stools normally and have a normal functioning bowel after surgery, although they may take a bit longer to toilet train. Some may experience persistent constipation and need to follow a high-fibre diet and take laxatives. Your doctor will advise about this treatment. A small number of children have problems controlling their bowels (bowel incontinence), which can last until they're a teenager and be very distressing.  Speak to your GP if this is a problem. You can also read advice about soiling in children. ","When to get medical advice":"Visit your GP if your child develops the symptoms described above. Hirschsprung's disease can be serious if left untreated, so it's important to get help as soon as possible. If your GP suspects the condition, they will refer you to hospital for tests to confirm the diagnosis. ","URL":"/conditions/hirschsprungs-disease","How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed":"Your child's tummy will usually be examined and sometimes a rectal examination may be carried out. This is where a doctor or nurse inserts a finger into the back passage (rectum) to feel for abnormalities. If Hirschsprung's disease is suspected, an X-ray can be done to show a blockage and bulge in the bowel. The diagnosis can be confirmed by doing a rectal biopsy, which involves inserting a small instrument into your child's bottom to remove a tiny sample of the affected bowel. This is then examined under the microscope to see if the nerve cells are missing. "},"Title":"Hirschsprung's disease"},"Abdominoplasty":{"Introduction":{"How much does it cost?":"A tummy tuck, or 'abdominoplasty', is cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the tummy area (abdomen). It can involve removing fat and excess loose skin and tightening the abdominal muscles. The aim is to remove excess tummy skin that can't be removed through exercise - for example, after losing a lot of weight or after pregnancy. But it\u2019s not a quick fix for losing weight. An abdominoplasty is regarded cosmetic surgery, so not normally available on the NHS. If you're thinking of going ahead, make sure you're aware of the cost and the fact that it's major surgery, with risks to consider. Take time to reflect on your decision.

You can read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems   Who shouldn't have it?  More information  It costs about £4,500 to £6,000 to have an abdominoplasty in the UK, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform a tummy tuck. All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC, which publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. You should also research the surgeon who is going to carry out your surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).

There are two types of tummy tuck, and both are usually carried out under a general anaesthetic. A partial tummy tuck involves: making a large incision (cut) across the lower tummy separating the skin from the abdominal wall below the tummy button removing excess fat cutting away excess skin pulling together the remaining skin and stitching it in place A full tummy tuck involves: making a large incision across the lower tummy, from hip to hip, just above the pubic area making a second incision to free the belly button from the tissue that surrounds it separating the skin from the abdominal wall realigning the abdominal muscles removing excess fat and skin cutting a new hole for the belly button, and stitching this back in place pulling together the remaining skin and stitching it in place The operation can take between two and five hours. Most people need to stay in hospital for a few nights. A tummy tuck may be quite painful, although pain relief would be provided. You would leave hospital with dressings and a pressure garment (corset) on your tummy, or tummy control pants. Someone would need to drive you home and stay with you for the following 24 hours. You would need to take about four to six weeks off work and exercise. You wouldn't be able to drive for a few weeks after the operation (your surgeon and insurance company would advise about this). It takes about six weeks to fully recover, and it may be several weeks before you see the full effects of the tummy tuck. You\u2019d need to wear a special type of corset or tummy control pants to encourage your skin to heal properly and reduce any swelling. Generally, you'd need to take it easy for a few weeks and keep your knees bent while in bed, to avoid putting strain on your stitches. After a week or two: A wound check would be carried out At six weeks: Your corset should be able to come off and you'd usually be able to return to most of your normal activities. You would be left with a scar running across your lower tummy and, if you had a full abdominoplasty, a scar around your belly button. It\u2019s also common after a tummy tuck to: find it difficult to stand up straight \u2013 it will feel like your tummy is being pulled (this will improve over time) have pain and bruises feel numbness in your tummy for a few months to years  have a temporary fluid-filled swelling above the scar have red, raised scars in the first six weeks \u2013 which eventually fade to white A tummy tuck can occasionally result in: thick, obvious scars developing bulges under the skin 'dog ears' (extra skin) at the edges of the scar wounds failing to heal a collection of fluid in the area that was operated on a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) numbness or pain in the tummy or down the leg tummy cramps or pain breathing problems Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (very rare) The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn\u2019t achieved and feel they need another operation. Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have a tummy tuck and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

As well as the treatments mentioned above, there are things you can do yourself to help ease your symptoms and prevent further problems.  ","Dietary changes":"Some foods, such as eggs and cows' milk, can trigger eczema symptoms. However, you shouldn't make significant changes to your diet without first speaking to your GP. It may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods. If your GP suspects a food allergy, you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition). They can help to work out a way to avoid the food you're allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need. Alternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician. If you're breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet. Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They're often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as atopic eczema. In addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have. ","Side effects":"Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause: thinning of the skin \u2013 especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks) changes in skin colour \u2013 usually, skin lightening after many months of using very strong steroids, but most lightening after eczema is a \"footprint\" of old inflammation and nothing to do with treatments acne (spots) \u2013 especially when used on the face in teenagers increased hair growth Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops. Your risk of side effects may be increased if you use a strong topical corticosteroid: for many months in sensitive areas such as the face, armpits or groin in large amounts You should be prescribed the weakest effective treatment to control your symptoms. Antihistamines are a type of medicine that block the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. They can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema. They can either be sedating, which cause drowsiness, or non-sedating. If you have severe itching, your GP may suggest trying a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your GP may suggest taking a sedating antihistamine. Sedating antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child's school know they may not be as alert as normal. In some cases, your GP may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema. These can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out. Corticosteroid tablets are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of five to seven days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control. Longer courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects. If your GP thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they'll probably refer you to a specialist. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). You may be referred if: your GP is not sure what type of eczema you have normal treatment isn't controlling your eczema your eczema is affecting your daily life it's not clear what's causing it A dermatologist may be able to offer the following: allergy testing a thorough review of your existing treatment \u2013 to make sure you are using enough of the right things at the right times topical calcineurin inhibitors \u2013 creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus very strong topical corticosteroids bandages or wet wraps phototherapy \u2013 ultraviolet (UV) light that reduces inflammation immunosuppressant tablets \u2013 to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate alitretinoin \u2013 medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adults A dermatologist may also offer additional support to help you use your treatments correctly, such as demonstrations from specialist nurses, and they may be able to refer you for psychological support if you feel you need it. Some people may find complementary therapies such as herbal remedies helpful in treating their eczema, but there's little evidence to show these remedies are effective. If you're thinking about using a complementary therapy, speak to your GP first to ensure the therapy is safe for you to use. Make sure you continue to use other treatments your GP has prescribed. Page last reviewed: 02/12/2016 Next review due: 02/12/2019 ","How to use emollients":"Use your emollient all the time, even if you're not experiencing symptoms. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school, or a tub in the bathroom and one in a living area. To apply the emollient: use a large amount don't rub it in \u2013 smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows after a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture in You should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin. During a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid as emollients used on their own aren't enough to control it. Don't put your fingers into an emollient pot \u2013 use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. And never share your emollient with other people. If your skin is sore and inflamed, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days. Topical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected. They can be: very mild (such as hydrocortisone) moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate) even stronger (such as mometasone) If you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your GP regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you're using the right amount. ","How to use topical corticosteroids":"Don't be afraid to apply the treatment to affected areas to control your eczema. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. This will give details of how much to apply. Most people only have to apply it once a day as there's no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often. When using a topical corticosteroid: apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night) apply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area continue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treated Occasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. This is designed to help prevent flare-ups. This is sometimes called \"weekend treatment\", where a person who has already gained control of their eczema uses the topical corticosteroid every weekend on the trouble sites to prevent them becoming active again. ","Avoid triggers":"Your GP will work with you to establish what might trigger the eczema flare-ups, although it may get better or worse for no obvious reason. Once you know your triggers, you can try to avoid them. For example: if certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton if heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom avoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin \u2013 use soap substitutes instead Although some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn't recommended as it can be difficult and there's no clear evidence that it helps. Read more about preventing allergies. ","Try to reduce the damage from scratching":"Eczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. But scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur. The skin eventually thickens into leathery areas as a result of chronic scratching. Deep scratching also causes bleeding and increases the risk of your skin becoming infected or scarred. Try to reduce scratching whenever possible. You could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. If your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin. Keep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. Keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching. ","URL":"/conditions/Eczema-(atopic)","Choosing an emollient":"Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. If you've been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product that suits you better. The best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day. "},"Introduction":{" ":"Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. However, it may also develop for the first time in adults. It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Other types of eczema Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body.             Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). Read about the symptoms of atopic eczema  See your GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions such as: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears when the symptoms first began whether it comes and goes over time whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and three or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin \u2013 such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma or hay fever \u2013 children under four must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of two (this does not apply to children under the age of four) The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing. Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies \u2013 \"atopic\" means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. Allergy tests aren't usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms. Read about the causes of atopic eczema. Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. However, there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There's also an increased risk of skin infections.  Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) \u2013 used on a daily basis for dry skin  topical corticosteroids \u2013 used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups Read about treating atopic eczema and complications of atopic eczema. Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: discoid eczema \u2013 a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin contact dermatitis \u2013 a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance varicose eczema \u2013 a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins seborrhoeic eczema \u2013 a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) \u2013 a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands Page last reviewed: 02/12/2016 Next review due: 02/12/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Eczema-(atopic)"},"Complications":{" ":"People with atopic eczema can sometimes develop further physical and psychological problems. As atopic eczema can cause your skin to become cracked and broken, there's a risk of the skin becoming infected with bacteria. The risk is higher if you scratch your eczema or don't use your treatments correctly. Signs of a bacterial infection can include: fluid oozing from the skin a yellow crust on the skin surface small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema the skin becoming swollen and sore a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell Your normal symptoms may also get rapidly worse and your eczema may not respond to your regular treatments. You should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected. They'll usually prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled. Speak to your GP if these don't help or your symptoms get worse. Once your infection has cleared, your GP will prescribe new supplies of any creams and ointments you're using to avoid contamination. Old treatments should be disposed of. It's also possible for eczema to become infected with the herpes simplex virus, which normally causes cold sores. This can develop into a serious condition called eczema herpeticum. Symptoms of eczema herpeticum include: areas of painful eczema that quickly get worse groups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin a high temperature and generally feeling unwell, in some cases              Contact your doctor immediately if you suspect eczema herpeticum. If you can't contact your GP, call NHS 111 or go to your nearest hospital. If you're diagnosed with eczema herpeticum, you'll be given an antiviral medication called aciclovir. As well as affecting you physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically. Preschool children with atopic eczema may be more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity than children who don't have the condition. They're also more likely to be more dependent on their parents. ","Bullying":"Schoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. Any kind of bullying can be traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with. Your child may become quiet and withdrawn. Explain the situation to your child's teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they're feeling. The National Eczema Society provides information about regional support groups, where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema. You can also read more about bullying. ","Problems sleeping":"Sleep-related problems are common among people with eczema. A lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. It may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work. If your child has problems sleeping because of their eczema, they may fall behind with their schoolwork. It might help to let their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration. During a severe eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. This may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies. ","Self-confidence":"Atopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. Children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may lead to them having a poor self-image. If your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. Support and encouragement will help boost your child's self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance. Speak to your GP if you're concerned your child's eczema is severely affecting their confidence. They may benefit from specialist psychological support.

People with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain much moisture. This dryness may make the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy. You may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents. Research has shown children who have one or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves. Atopic eczema isn't infectious, so it can't be passed on through close contact. There are a number of things that may trigger your eczema symptoms. These can vary from person to person. Common triggers include: irritants \u2013 such as soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid and bubble bath environmental factors or allergens \u2013 such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds food allergies \u2013 such as allergies to cows' milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat certain materials worn next to the skin \u2013 such as wool and synthetic fabrics hormonal changes \u2013 women may find their symptoms get worse in the days before their period or during pregnancy skin infections Some people also report their symptoms get worse when the air is dry or dusty, or when they are stressed, sweaty, or too hot or too cold.

There are usually periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as two or three times a month. Atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children.             The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching. Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work. Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It's not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a \"footprint\" of old inflammation and eventually returns to its normal colour. Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include: your eczema getting a lot worse fluid oozing from the skin a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema the skin becoming swollen and sore a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell See your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected.

The aim of the Alexander technique is to help you \"unlearn\" these bad habits and achieve a balanced, more naturally aligned body. ","Learning the Alexander technique":"The Alexander technique is taught by a qualified teacher (see Finding a teacher below for information about training) in one-to-one lessons. Lessons often take place in a studio, clinic or the teacher's house and usually last 30-45 minutes. You'll be asked to wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing so you're able to move easily. The teacher will observe your movements and show you how to move, sit, lie down and stand with better balance and less strain. They'll use their hands to gently guide you in your movements, help you maintain a better relationship between your head, neck and spine, and to release muscle tension. You'll need to attend a number of lessons to learn the basic concepts of the Alexander technique. Often, around 20 or more weekly lessons are recommended. Teachers of the technique say you may see an improvement in aches and pains fairly soon after starting the lessons, but that you need to be committed to putting what you learn into practice and it may take a considerable amount of time to see the full benefits. The overall aim is to help you gain an understanding of the main principles involved so you can apply them to everyday life, allowing you to benefit from the technique without the need for frequent ongoing lessons. ","Availability and regulation":"Alexander technique lessons are mostly available privately. Each lesson usually costs around £35-50. However, in recent years some NHS trusts have started to offer Alexander technique lessons as part of their outpatient pain clinics. Ask your GP whether it's available through the NHS in your local area. If you\u2019re thinking about trying the Alexander technique, it's important to choose a teacher who's experienced and qualified. There aren't currently any laws or regulations stating what training someone must have to teach the Alexander technique. Professional organisations offer courses (often for three years) and membership upon successful completion of the course. Teachers must meet certain requirements to register with these organisations and agree to comply with their code of ethics. In the UK, the main organisations for teachers of the Alexander technique are the: Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CHNC) Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique (STAT) Interactive Teaching Method Association (ITM) Professional Association of Alexander Teachers (PAAT) Alexander Technique International (ATI) Of these, only the CHNC has been accredited by the Professional Standards Authority. ","Introduction ":"The Alexander technique teaches improved posture and movement, which is believed to help reduce and prevent problems caused by unhelpful habits. During a number of lessons you're taught to be more aware of your body, how to improve poor posture and move more efficiently. Teachers of the Alexander technique believe this helps get rid of tension in your body and relieves problems such as back pain, neck ache, sore shoulders and other musculoskeletal problems. Evidence suggests the technique has the potential to improve certain health conditions, but there are some claims made about the technique that haven\u2019t been scientifically tested (see Does it work? below). ","Risks and limitations":"For most people, Alexander technique lessons are safe and pose no health risks. No manipulation of your body is involved, just gentle touch. However, the technique may not be suitable for certain people, such as those with: a specific spinal injury severe pain from a herniated (ruptured) disc severe spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine) a fracture of the vertebrae (the bones in the spine) In such cases, specialist medical treatment will be needed. It's important to remember that most teachers of the Alexander technique aren't medical professionals. They do not diagnose, offer advice on or treat conditions that should be managed by a suitably qualified mainstream healthcare professional. Page last reviewed: 22/07/2015 Next review due: 01/07/2018 ","Does it work?":"Proponents of the Alexander technique often claim it can help people with a wide range of health conditions. Some of these claims are supported by scientific evidence, but some have not yet been properly tested. There's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with: long-term back pain \u2013 lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain-associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to a year or more long-term neck pain \u2013 lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to a year or more Parkinson's disease \u2013 lessons in the technique may help you carry out everyday tasks more easily and improve how you feel about your condition If you have one of these conditions and are considering trying the Alexander technique, it's a good idea to speak to your GP or specialist first to check if it might be suitable for you. Some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed. There's currently little evidence to suggest the Alexander technique can help improve other health conditions, including asthma, headaches, osteoarthritis, difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and stress.

If you experience any additional side effects other than those listed above, you should contact your GP or the doctor in charge of your care for advice. ","Antibiotic allergic reactions":"Around 1 in 15 people have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and cephalosporins. In most cases, the allergic reaction is mild to moderate and can take the form of: a raised, itchy skin rash (urticaria, or hives) coughing  wheezing tightness of the throat, which can cause breathing difficulties These mild to moderate allergic reactions can usually be successfully treated by taking antihistamines. But if you're concerned, or your symptoms don't respond to treatment, you should call your GP for advice. If you can't contact your GP, call NHS 111. In rare cases, an antibiotic can cause a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.

Read more about antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics may also be recommended for people who are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of infection. This may include: people aged over 75 years babies less than 72 hours old with a confirmed bacterial infection, or a higher than average risk of developing one people with heart failure people who have to take insulin to control their diabetes people with a weakened immune system \u2013 either because of an underlying health condition such as HIV infection or as a side effect of certain treatments, such as chemotherapy Antibiotics are sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection. This is known as antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is normally recommended if you're having surgery on a certain part of the body which carries a high risk of infection or where infection could lead to devastating effects. For example, it may be used if you're going to have: some types of eye surgery \u2013 such as cataract surgery or glaucoma surgery joint replacement surgery breast implant surgery pacemaker surgery surgery to remove the gall bladder surgery to remove the appendix Your surgical team will be able to tell you if you require antibiotic prophylaxis. ","Medical conditions":"There are several medical conditions that make people particularly vulnerable to infection, making antibiotic prophylaxis necessary. For example, the spleen plays an important role in filtering out harmful bacteria from the blood. People who have had their spleen removed, people having chemotherapy for cancer, or those with the blood disorder sickle cell anaemia, where their spleen doesn't work properly, should take antibiotics to prevent infection. In some cases, antibiotic prophylaxis is prescribed for people who experience a recurring infection that's causing distress or an increased risk of complications, such as:  cellulitis a urinary tract infection genital herpes rheumatic fever Page last reviewed: 09/06/2016 Next review due: 01/12/2018 ","Bites or wounds":"Antibiotic prophylaxis may be recommended for a wound that has a high chance of becoming infected \u2013 this could be an animal or human bite, for example, or a wound that has come into contact with soil or faeces.

Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that: are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics could infect others unless treated could take too long to clear without treatment carry a risk of more serious complications People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis. Read more about when antibiotics are used. Take antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist. Doses of antibiotics can be provided in several ways: Oral antibiotics \u2013 tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink, which can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body Topical antibiotics \u2013 creams, lotions, sprays or drops, which are often used to treat skin infections Injections of antibiotics \u2013 these can be given as an injection or infusion through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are usually reserved for more serious infections It's essential to finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise. If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic. ","Missing a dose of antibiotics":"If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. But if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one. There's an increased risk of side effects if you take two doses closer together than recommended. ","Accidentally taking an extra dose":"Accidentally taking one extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. But it will increase your chances of experiencing side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick. If you accidentally take more than one extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or experiencing severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible. As with any medication, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics don't cause problems if they're used properly and serious side effects are rare. The most common side effects include: being sick feeling sick bloating and indigestion diarrhoea Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and a type called cephalosporins. In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency. Read more about the side effects of antibiotics. Some antibiotics aren't suitable for people with certain medical conditions, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You should only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you \u2013 never \"borrow\" them from a friend or family member. Some antibiotics can also react unpredictably with other medications, such as the oral contraceptive pill and alcohol. It's important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP. Read more about: things to consider before taking antibiotics how antibiotics interact with other medicines There are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be broadly classified into six groups. These are outlined below. Penicillins (such as penicillin and amoxicillin) \u2013 widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections Cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) \u2013 used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as septicaemia and meningitis Aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) \u2013 tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as septicaemia, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they're usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections Tetracyclines (such as tetracycline and doxycycline)\u2013 can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat moderate to severe acne and rosacea Macrolides (such as erythromycin and clarithromycin) \u2013 can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) \u2013 broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used to treat a wide range of infections Both the NHS and health organisations across the world are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren't serious. The overuse of antibiotics in recent years means they're becoming less effective and has led to the emergence of \"superbugs\". These are strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to many different types of antibiotics, including: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  Clostridium difficile (C. diff) the bacteria that cause multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) These types of infections can be serious and challenging to treat, and are becoming an increasing cause of disability and death across the world. The biggest worry is that new strains of bacteria may emerge that can't be effectively treated by any existing antibiotics.

Page last reviewed: 09/06/2016 Next review due: 01/12/2018 ","Cephalosporins ":"If you previously had an allergic reaction to penicillin, there's a chance that you may also be allergic to cephalosporins. Cephalosporins may not be suitable if you have kidney disease, but if you need one you will probably be given a lower than usual dose. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or have acute porphyria, check with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before taking cephalosporins. ","Tetracyclines":"The use of tetracyclines isn't usually recommended unless absolutely necessary in the following groups: people with kidney disease \u2013 except doxycycline, which can be used people with liver disease people with the autoimmune condition lupus \u2013 which can cause skin problems, joint pain and swelling, and fatigue (feeling tired all the time) children under the age of 12 pregnant or breastfeeding women ","Macrolides":"You shouldn't take macrolides if you have porphyria \u2013 a rare inherited blood disorder. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, the only type of macrolide you can take is erythromycin (Erymax, Erythrocin, Erythroped or Erythroped A) unless a different antibiotic is recommended by your doctor. Erythromycin can be used at the usual doses throughout your pregnancy and while you're breastfeeding. Other macrolides shouldn't be used during pregnancy, unless advised by a specialist. ","Penicillin":"Don't take one of the penicillin-based antibiotics if you've had an allergic reaction to them in the past. People who are allergic to one type of penicillin will be allergic to all of them. People with a history of allergies, such as asthma, eczema or hay fever, are at higher risk of developing a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to penicillins, although cases are rare. Penicillins may need to be used at lower doses and with extra caution if you have: severe kidney disease liver disease Most penicillins can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding in the usual doses. Tell your healthcare professional if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, so they can prescribe the most suitable antibiotic for you. ","Aminoglycosides":"Aminoglycosides are normally only used in hospital to treat life-threatening conditions such as septicaemia, as they can cause kidney damage in people with pre-existing kidney disease. They're only used during pregnancy if your doctor believes they're essential.

This means it can have an effect that is different to what you expected. Some of the more common interactions are listed below, but this isn't a complete list. If you want to check that your medicines are safe to take with your antibiotics, ask your GP or local pharmacist. Some antibiotics need to be taken with food, while others need to be taken on an empty stomach. You should always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should completely avoid alcohol while taking the antibiotics metronidazole or tinidazole, and for 48 hours afterwards, as this combination can cause very unpleasant side effects, such as: feeling and being sick stomach pain hot flushes headaches It's recommended that you don't drink alcohol while taking antibiotics. However, as long as you drink in moderation, alcohol is unlikely to interact significantly with your medication. Read more information about drinking alcohol while taking antibiotics. Some antibiotics, such as rifampicin and rifabutin, can reduce the effectiveness of the combined oral contraceptive pill. If you're prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, while taking antibiotics. Speak to your GP, nurse or pharmacist for advice. Some of the medications you may need to avoid, or seek advice on, while taking a specific class of antibiotic are outlined below. ","Fluoroquinolones":"You should check with your GP or pharmacist before taking a fluoroquinolone if you're currently taking any of the following: theophylline \u2013 used to treat asthma; also found in some cough and cold medicines non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) painkillers \u2013 such as ibuprofen ciclosporin probenecid \u2013 used to treat gout clozapine \u2013 used to treat schizophrenia ropinirole \u2013 used to treat Parkinson's disease tizanadine \u2013 used to treat muscle spasms glibenclamide \u2013 used to treat diabetes cisapride \u2013 used to treat indigestion, heartburn, vomiting or nausea tricyclic antidepressants \u2013 such as amitriptyline steroid medications (corticosteroids) Some fluoroquinolones can intensify the effects of caffeine (a stimulant found in coffee, tea and cola), which could make you feel irritable, restless and cause problems falling asleep (insomnia). You may need to avoid taking medication that contains high levels of minerals or iron, as this can block the beneficial effects of fluoroquinolones. This includes: antacids zinc supplements some types of multivitamin supplements Page last reviewed: 09/06/2016 Next review due: 01/12/2018 ","Cephalosporins":"Cephalosporins may increase the chance of bleeding if you're taking blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) such as heparin and warfarin. If you need treatment with cephalosporins, you may need to have your dose of anticoagulants changed or additional blood monitoring. ","Tetracyclines":"You should check with your GP or pharmacist before taking a tetracycline if you're currently taking any of the following: vitamin A supplements retinoids \u2013 such as acitretin, isotretinoin and tretinoin, which are used to treat severe acne blood-thinning medication diuretics kaolin-pectin and bismuth subsalicylate \u2013 used to treat diarrhoea medicines to treat diabetes \u2013 such as insulin atovaquone \u2013 used to treat pneumonia antacids \u2013 used to treat indigestion and heartburn sucralfate \u2013 used to treat ulcers lithium \u2013 used to treat bipolar disorder and severe depression digoxin \u2013 used to treat heart rhythm disorders methotrexate strontium ranelate \u2013 used to treat osteoporosis colestipol or colestyramine \u2013 used to treat high cholesterol ergotamine and methysergide \u2013 used to treat migraines ","Macrolides":"It's highly recommended that you don't combine a macrolide with any of the following medications unless directly instructed to by your GP, as the combination could cause heart problems: terfenadine, astemizole and mizolastine \u2013 these are all antihistamines used to treat allergic conditions such as hay fever amisulpride \u2013 used to treat episodes of psychosis tolterodine \u2013 used to treat urinary incontinence statins \u2013 used to treat high cholesterol ","Penicillins":"It's usually recommended that you avoid taking penicillin at the same time as methotrexate, which is used to treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and some forms of cancer. This is because combining the two medications can cause a range of unpleasant and sometimes serious side effects. However, some forms of penicillin, such as amoxicillin, can be used in combination with methotrexate. You may experience a skin rash if you take penicillin and allopurinol, which is used to treat gout. ","Aminoglycosides":"The risk of damage to your kidneys and hearing is increased if you're taking one or more of the following medications: antifungals \u2013 used to treat fungal infections cyclosporin \u2013 used to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease and given to people who have had an organ transplant  diuretics \u2013 used to remove water from the body muscle relaxants The risk of kidney and hearing damage has to be balanced against the benefits of using aminoglycosides to treat life-threatening conditions such as septicaemia. In hospital, blood levels are carefully monitored to ensure the antibiotic is only present in the blood in safe amounts. If aminoglycosides are used properly in topical preparations, such as ear drops, these side effects don't occur.

The best option for you will depend on the position of your fistula and whether it's a single channel or branches off in different directions. Sometimes you may need to have an initial examination of the area under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) to help determine the best treatment. Your surgeon will talk to you about the options available and which one they feel is the most suitable for you. Surgery for an anal fistula is usually carried out under general anaesthetic. In many cases, it's not necessary to stay in hospital overnight afterwards. The aim of surgery is to heal the fistula while avoiding damage to the sphincter muscles, the ring of muscles that open and close the anus, which could potentially result in loss of bowel control bowel incontinence). The main options are outlined below. The most common type of surgery for anal fistulas is a fistulotomy. This involves cutting along the whole length of the fistula to open it up so it heals as a flat scar. A fistulotomy is the most effective treatment for many anal fistulas, although it's usually only suitable for fistulas that don't pass through much of the sphincter muscles, as the risk of incontinence is lowest in these cases. If your surgeon has to cut a small portion of anal sphincter muscle during the procedure, they will make every attempt to reduce the risk of incontinence. In cases where the risk of incontinence is considered too high, one of the procedures below may be recommended instead. If your fistula passes through a significant portion of anal sphincter muscle, your surgeon may initially recommend inserting a seton. A seton is a piece of surgical thread that is left in the fistula for several weeks to keep it open. This allows it to drain and helps it heal, while avoiding the need to cut the sphincter muscles. Loose setons allow fistulas to drain, but don't cure them. To cure a fistula, tighter setons may be used to cut through the fistula slowly. This may require several procedures that your surgeon can discuss with you. Alternatively, they may suggest carrying out several fistulotomy procedures, carefully opening up a small section of the fistula each time, or one of the treatments described below.  An advancement flap procedure may be considered if your fistula passes through the anal sphincter muscles and having a fistulotomy carries a high risk of causing incontinence. This involves cutting or scraping out the fistula and covering the hole where it entered the bowel with a flap of tissue taken from inside the rectum, which is the final part of the bowel. This has a lower success rate than a fistulotomy, but avoids the need to cut the anal sphincter muscles. Another option in cases where a fistulotomy carries a high risk of incontinence is the insertion of a bioprosthetic plug. This is a cone-shaped plug made from animal tissue that is used to block the internal opening of the fistula. Some studies have suggested this may be an effective treatment for anal fistulas, but more evidence is needed to be certain. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) currently recommends carrying out the procedure as part of medical research. Read NICE guidance on closure of anal fistula using a suturable bioprosthetic plug. The ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure is a relatively new treatment for anal fistulas. It's designed as a treatment for fistulas that pass through the anal sphincter muscles, where a fistulotomy would be too risky. During the treatment, a cut (incision) is made in the skin above the fistula and the sphincter muscles are moved apart. The fistula is then sealed at both ends and cut open so it lies flat. This procedure has had some promising results so far, but it's only been around for a few years, so more research is needed to determine how well it works in the short and long term. Treatment with fibrin glue is currently the only non-surgical option for anal fistulas. It involves your surgeon injecting a special glue into your fistula while you're under a general anaesthetic. The glue helps seal the fistula and encourages it to heal. It's generally less effective than fistulotomy for simple fistulas and the results may not be long-lasting, but it may be a useful option for fistulas that pass through the anal sphincter muscles because they don't need to be cut. Like any type of treatment, treatment for anal fistulas carries a number of risks. The main risks are: infection \u2013 this may require a course of antibiotics; severe cases may need to be treated in hospital recurrence of the fistula \u2013 the fistula can sometimes recur despite surgery bowel incontinence \u2013 this is a potential risk with most types of anal fistula treatment, although severe incontinence is rare and every effort will be made to prevent it The level of risk will depend on things like where your fistula is located and the specific procedure you have. Speak to your surgeon about the potential risks of the procedure they recommend.

They're usually the result of an infection near the anus causing a collection of pus (abscess) in the nearby tissue. When the pus drains away, it can leave a small channel behind. Anal fistulas can cause unpleasant symptoms, such as discomfort and skin irritation, and won't usually get better on their own. Surgery is recommended in most cases. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatments Symptoms of an anal fistula can include: skin irritation around the anus a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down, move around, have a bowel movement or cough smelly discharge from near your anus  passing pus or blood when you poo swelling and redness around your anus and a high temperature (fever), if you also have an abscess difficulty controlling bowel movements (bowel incontinence) in some cases The end of the fistula might be visible as a hole in the skin near your anus, although this may be difficult for you to see yourself. See your GP if you have persistent symptoms of an anal fistula. They'll ask about your symptoms and whether you have any bowel conditions. They may also ask to examine your anus and gently insert a finger inside it (rectal examination) to check for signs of a fistula. If your GP thinks you might have a fistula, they can refer you to a specialist called a colorectal surgeon for further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most suitable treatment. These may include: a further physical and rectal examination a proctoscopy \u2013 where a special telescope with a light on the end is used to look inside your anus an ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or computerised tomography (CT) scan Most anal fistulas develop after an anal abscess. They can occur if the abscess doesn't heal properly after the pus has drained away. It's estimated that between one in every two to four people with an anal abscess will develop a fistula. Less common causes of anal fistulas include: Crohn's disease \u2013 a long-term condition in which the digestive system becomes inflamed diverticulitis \u2013 infection of the small pouches that can stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon) hidradenitis suppurativa \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes abscesses and scarring infection with tuberculosis (TB) or HIV a complication of surgery near the anus Anal fistulas usually require surgery as they rarely heal if left untreated. The main options include: a fistulotomy \u2013 a procedure that involves cutting open the whole length of the fistula so it heals into a flat scar seton procedures \u2013 where a piece of surgical thread called a seton is placed in the fistula and left there for several weeks to help it heal before a further procedure is carried out to treat it other techniques \u2013 including filling the fistula with special glue, blocking it with a special plug, or covering it with a flap of tissue All these procedures have different benefits and risks. You can discuss this with your surgeon. Many people don't need to stay in hospital overnight after surgery, although some may need to stay in hospital for a few days.

It usually occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting about 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They don't usually cause symptoms, but they can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. This topic covers: Symptoms of acute cholecystitis When to seek medical advice What causes acute cholecysitis Diagnosing cholecystitis Treating cholecystitis Possible complications Preventing cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the abdomen is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and doesn't go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature (fever) nausea and vomiting sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the abdomen See your GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever. If you're unable to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible as there's a risk serious complications could develop if it isn't treated promptly.   The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into two main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. ","The gallbladder":"The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. Over time bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it more effective at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. The gallbladder is an organ that's useful, but not essential. It can safely be removed without interfering with your ability to digest food. Page last reviewed: 04/08/2016 Next review due: 04/08/2019 ","Surgery":"Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy. Although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you're too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that's built up in the gallbladder. If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. In some cases you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or two, or it may be necessary to wait a few weeks until the inflammation has settled down. Surgery can be carried out in three ways: laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single incision, which is usually made near the bellybutton open cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single larger incision in the abdomen Although some people who've had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Read more about recovering from gallbladder removal. Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) \u2013 which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) \u2013 which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about one in every five cases of acute cholecystitis. It isn't always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. However, low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.  Read more about preventing gallstones. ","Initial treatment":"Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medication to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. After initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused acute cholecystitis usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation will often settle down. ","Acalculous cholecystitis":"Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. Acalculous cholecystitis can be caused by accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, blood poisoning (sepsis), severe malnutrition or AIDS. If you have severe abdominal pain, your GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests \u2013 to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your abdomen \u2013 to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Other scans \u2013 such as an X-ray, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there's any uncertainty about your diagnosis. If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. ","Calculous cholecystitis":"Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around one in every five cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria. ","URL":"/conditions/Cholecystitis-acute"},"Title":"Acute cholecystitis"},"ARLD":{"Treatment":{" ":"Successful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle. Treatment for ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at. If you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least two weeks. After this point, it's usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption. If you have a more serious form of ARLD \u2013 alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis \u2013 life-long abstinence is recommended. This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease. Stopping drinking isn't easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem. Nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don't stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure. ","Withdrawal symptoms":"If you're abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes three to seven days from the time of your last drink. Many people initially experience disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month. In some cases, you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process. Some people need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so their progress can be closely monitored. If you're staying at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service. ","Self-help groups":"Many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is Alcoholics Anonymous, but there are many other groups that can help. See alcohol support for more information about the help available. Malnutrition is common in people with ARLD, so it's important to eat a balanced diet to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need. Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid. See tips for a lower salt diet for more information. The damage to your liver can also mean it's unable to store glycogen \u2013 a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet. Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat three or four small meals a day, rather than one or two large meals. Your GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian. In the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube inserted through the nose and into the stomach. The use of medication to directly treat ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued there's limited evidence for its effectiveness. For people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. Specific treatment with corticosteroids or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition. Nutritional support (see above) is also an important part of treatment in these cases. Other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include: anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication) ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat overactive thyroid glands) However, there's a lack of good evidence that these help and they're no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis. In the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to liver failure. A liver transplant is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure. A liver transplant may be considered if: you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol you're otherwise well enough to survive such an operation you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life If you have ARLD, it's important to talk to your GP or pharmacist before taking over-the-counter or prescription medications. ARLD can affect the way the body processes some medications.

The first treatment usually offered is psychological therapy. This involves seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing. If psychological therapy alone isn't effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as:  acamprosate naltrexone disulfiram Read our page on treating alcohol misuse for more information on the treatments offered. "},"Introduction":{" ":"Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. ARLD doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Read more about: symptoms of ARLD diagnosing ARLD With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is very common in the UK \u2013 the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD. There are three main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below. ","Cirrhosis":"Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. A person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least five more years. There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol support services. A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Read more about treating ARLD. Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure. Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer Read more about the complications of ARLD. The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health. See our drinking and alcohol pages for more information and advice. Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","Alcoholic hepatitis":"Alcoholic hepatitis \u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis \u2013 is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. ","Alcoholic fatty liver disease":"Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for two weeks, your liver should return to normal. ","URL":"/conditions/Liver_disease_(alcoholic)"},"Complications":{" ":"A number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD). Some of the main complications associated with the condition are described below. Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis. It occurs when the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level. When the liver becomes severely scarred, it's harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines. The blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These new blood vessels are known as varices. If the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the walls of the varices to split and bleed. This can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to anaemia. Alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like. Split varices can be treated by using an endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices. A person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites. Initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic. One of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death. One of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. If the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the blood increase. A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy. Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include: agitation confusion disorientation muscle stiffness muscle tremors difficulty speaking in very serious cases, a coma Hepatic encephalopathy may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood. Liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing liver cancer. Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse. It's estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with cirrhosis will develop liver cancer.

The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD. There are two ways alcohol misuse (drinking too much) can cause ARLD. These are: drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time (binge drinking) can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause hepatitis and cirrhosis, the more serious types of ARLD Evidence suggests people who regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week Read more about alcohol units and how to calculate them. As well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These include: being overweight or obese being female \u2013 women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol having a pre-existing liver condition, such as hepatitis C  genetics \u2013 alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Liver_disease_(alcoholic)"},"Title":"Alcohol-related liver disease","Diagnosis":{" ":"Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver. This is because the condition causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages. If a doctor suspects ARLD, they'll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption. It's important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. This could lead to a delay in the treatment you need. Blood tests used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal at many stages of liver disease. Blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn't functioning properly. A blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage. Lab Tests Online has more information on liver function tests. If your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD \u2013 either alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis \u2013 you may need further tests. These are described below. ","Liver biopsy":"During a liver biopsy, a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. The biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. Specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage. ","Endoscopy":"An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end. During an endoscopy, the instrument is passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach. Pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis. Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Liver_disease_(alcoholic)","Imaging tests":"Scans may be needed to produce detailed images of your liver. This may include: an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred. "},"Symptoms":{" ":"In many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don't have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged. If you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these are often quite vague, such as: abdominal (tummy) pain  loss of appetite fatigue feeling sick diarrhoea feeling generally unwell As the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as: yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to a build-up of fluid (oedema) swelling in your abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites a high temperature (fever) and shivering attacks very itchy skin hair loss unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers) blotchy red palms significant weight loss weakness and muscle wasting confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (insomnia) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to internal bleeding a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can't process them) ARLD doesn't often cause symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of the symptoms above. Read about alcohol misuse (drinking too much).  Contact your GP for advice if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse. A good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of four questions: Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking? Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? Have you ever drunk an \"eye-opener\", which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves? If you answer \"yes\" to one or more of the questions above, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP. See your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD.

Try to avoid places where the aspergillus fungus is likely to be found, such as: compost heaps grain stores rotting vegetation piles of dead leaves marshland and bogs forests In buildings, try to minimise your exposure to the fungus by reducing and containing dust as much as possible \u2013 particularly during construction work. Keep windows closed if there's a lot of dust or digging outside. ","Preventing aspergillosis ":"It's virtually impossible to avoid the aspergillus mould completely, but there are some precautions you can take to reduce your risk of developing aspergillosis. These precautions are particularly important if you're at a high risk of aspergillosis. ","URL":"/conditions/Aspergillosis"},"Treatment":{"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis":"Treatment for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) involves taking antifungal medication to tackle the infection and having treatment to boost your immune system. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary. Voriconazole is a powerful antifungal medication that's usually used to treat IPA. It can be given directly through a drip into a vein (intravenously) or as tablets. If you're diagnosed with IPA, it's likely that you'll be admitted to hospital so that you can be carefully monitored while you're on voriconazole. You may be given assistance with your breathing if you need it. Common side effects of voriconazole include: blurred vision or seeing colours (this is temporary and not dangerous) vivid dreams a rash on your skin that gets worse after exposure to the sun a high temperature (fever) diarrhoea breathing difficulties tingling or numbness in your feet or hands Less common side effects include depression, anxiety, insomnia, fainting and a very fast or very slow heartbeat. Most people with IPA also have a weakened immune system, so will be given treatment to help strengthen it. This may involve reducing the dose of any medication you're currently taking that weakens your immune system \u2013 such as anti-rejection (immunosuppressant) medication following an organ transplant. Additional medication can also be given to temporarily boost your immune system, such as colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). CSFs encourage your bone marrow to produce more white blood cells, which help fight infection. The most common side effects of CSFs include joint and muscle pain, headaches and nausea. In severe cases, where antifungal medications aren't helping and the infection has spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body, such as the skin, surgery may be needed to remove the infected areas. ","Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and aspergilloma":"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) often requires long-term treatment with antifungal medication, but occasionally surgery may be necessary. An aspergilloma (fungal ball in the lungs) doesn't always need to be treated, but sometimes antifungals may be prescribed or surgery may be carried out. Itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole are the antifungals used to treat chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and aspergilloma. Itraconazole is usually tried first, but if it\u2019s ineffective or has troublesome side effects, voriconazole or posaconazole may be used instead. These medicines are usually taken as a liquid or tablets, although antifungal injections may be used if these don\u2019t work. How long you'll need to take these for will depend on how well your symptoms react to them. Some people will require lifelong treatment. Itraconazole comes in tablet and liquid form. The tablets need to be taken with food, while the liquid needs to be taken on a empty stomach. Common side effects of itraconazole include: headaches feeling sick liver problems ankle swelling abdominal (tummy) pain diarrhoea or constipation an itchy rash Less common side effects can include peripheral neuropathy (tingling or numbness, usually in the feet or hands), hair loss, blurred or double vision, and tinnitus. Like all antifungal medications, itraconazole can interact with other medications, so it\u2019s important to let your doctor know if you're taking any other medicines. You can check the interactions between antifungals and other medicines on the Aspergillus & Aspergillosis Website. Posaconazole also comes in liquid and tablet form. The liquid has to be taken with a fatty meal, while the tablet can be taken with or without food. Possible side effects of posaconazole include feeling sick, liver problems and peripheral neuropathy. You can read about the side effects of voriconazole below. If you have CPA, surgery may be carried out to: remove an aspergilloma block some blood vessels in the lungs if you experience severe bleeding remove part of a lung or an entire infected lung if antifungals aren't helping Many people who have surgery to remove a lung worry that they'll be unable to breathe properly afterwards, but it's possible to breathe normally with just one lung. ","Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation":"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) are often treated using steroid medication and antifungal medication. Measures to reduce your risk of further exposure to the aspergillus mould may also help. Read more about preventing aspergillosis. Steroid tablets suppress the immune system, which helps to prevent the allergic reaction associated with ABPA and SAFS. Treatment is usually required for at least a few months, to help keep  symptoms under control. However, taking steroids for a long time can lead to side effects such as weight gain, high blood pressure and osteoporosis. You'll need regular check-ups during treatment to check for these. An antifungal medication called itraconazole is often used to treat ABPA and SAFS. It works by killing the aspergillus mould that causes these conditions. If you have asthma, bear in mind that itraconazole can increase the effectiveness of some steroid treatments you may be using to control the condition. This means that, when steroids are stopped, it is possible that you may experience symptoms of steroid withdrawal (such as weight loss, muscle weakness and low blood pressure). Some steroids are affected by itraconazole more than others, so make sure to check with your doctor. Even inhaled steroids used for asthma can be affected by itraconazole. You can read more about interactions between antifungals and other medicines on the Aspergillus & Aspergillosis Website.

"},"Introduction":{"Types of aspergillosis":"The main types of aspergillosis that affect the lungs are: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis chronic pulmonary aspergillosis invasive pulmonary aspergillosis Aspergillus mould can also sometimes infect other parts of the body, including the skin, eyes, sinuses and other internal organs, mainly in people with a weak immune system. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is caused by an allergy to inhaled aspergillus particles and typically causes wheezing, shortness of breath, a cough with mucus and sometimes blood. It's caused by the immune system reacting to the aspergillus mould. ABPA usually affects people with asthma or cystic fibrosis. It's estimated that around 1 in every 40 people with asthma may be affected by ABPA. There's also a very similar condition called severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS). Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a long-term infection that usually only affects people with an underlying lung condition, such as tuberculosis (TB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) or sarcoidosis. Along with a persistent cough, breathlessness, tiredness and weight loss, coughing up blood is a common symptom. CPA can sometimes cause an aspergilloma (a fungal ball) to grow in the lungs. It can also result in the lungs becoming permanently scarred if it isn't treated.  It's estimated that around 400-750 people in England have CPA. CPA requires specialist follow up treatment with antifungal medications and is usually long-term. The National Aspergillosis Centre offers specialist follow up of patients with CPA. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) usually only affects people with a weak immune system, such as people who have received a bone marrow transplant or cancer treatment, or those with HIV or AIDS. It's the most serious type of aspergillosis. If you have IPA, it's likely you'll have a raised temperature as well as lung symptoms, such as a cough, chest pain or breathlessness. In IPA, the aspergillus mould can spread through the bloodstream from the lungs to the brain, eyes, heart or kidneys. This is very serious and can be life-threatening if it's not treated quickly. IPA is estimated to affect up to one in every four people who've had a bone marrow transplant, a heart or lung transplant, or high-dose chemotherapy for leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells).

CPA and aspergilloma can be treated with long-term antifungal medication. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove an aspergilloma from the lungs, prevent bleeding in the lungs, or remove infected tissue. IPA is treated in hospital with powerful antifungal medications given by a drip into a vein. The infection can spread very quickly, and people who develop IPA are usually already very ill.

Your medical history will also be taken into account, as the different types of aspergillosis are associated with different underlying health problems. ABPA and SAFS are closely associated with asthma or cystic fibrosis, whereas invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) occurs more often in people with weakened immune systems. ","Diagnosing aspergillosis ":"If it's possible that you have aspergillosis, a number of checks and tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type. ","Allergy tests":"If ABPA or SAFS is suspected, you'll usually have a skin prick test. Your skin will be pricked with a needle that contains a small amount of aspergillus mould.

An arrhythmia is an abnormality of the heart's rhythm. It may beat too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly. These abnormalities range from a minor inconvenience or discomfort to a potentially fatal problem. ","Could you have an arrhythmia?":"Symptoms of arrhythmias include palpitations, feeling dizzy, fainting and being short of breath, although having these symptoms does not always mean you have a heart rhythm problem. Arrhythmia Alliance's heart rhythm checklist can help you gather information to discuss with your GP if you have any of these symptoms. ","Introduction ":"Arrhythmias or heart rhythm problems are experienced by more than 2 million people a year in the UK. Most people with an abnormal heart rhythm can lead a normal life if it is properly diagnosed. The main types of arrhythmia are: atrial fibrillation (AF) \u2013 this is the most common type, where the heart beats irregularly and faster than normal supraventricular tachycardia \u2013 episodes of abnormally fast heart rate at rest bradycardia \u2013 the heart beats more slowly than normal heart block \u2013 the heart beats more slowly than normal and can cause people to collapse ventricular fibrillation \u2013 a rare, rapid and disorganised rhythm of heartbeats that rapidly leads to loss of consciousness and sudden death if not treated immediately Arrhythmias can affect all age groups, but atrial fibrillation is more common in older people. Drinking alcohol in excess or being overweight increases your likelihood of developing atrial fibrillation. You may also be at risk of developing an arrhythmia if your heart tissue is damaged because of an illness \u2013 for example, if you have had a heart attack or have heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke. Having atrial fibrillation means your risk of stroke is five times higher than for someone whose heart rhythm is normal. Certain types of arrhythmia occur in people with severe heart conditions, and can cause sudden cardiac death. This kills 100,000 people in the UK every year. Some of these deaths could be avoided if the arrhythmias were diagnosed earlier. Common triggers for an arrhythmia are viral illnesses, alcohol, tobacco, changes in posture, exercise, drinks containing caffeine, and certain over-the-counter, prescribed and illegal recreational drugs. ","How do you lower your risk of an arrhythmia?":"It is not always possible to prevent an arrhythmia developing, although a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of developing a heart condition. Treatment aims to prevent future episodes. You can also make lifestyle changes so you avoid some of the triggers for your heart rhythm problem. ","Treatment for arrhythmias":"How your arrhythmia will be treated will depend on whether it is a fast or slow arrhythmia or heart block. Any underlying causes of your arrhythmia, such as heart failure, will need to be treated as well. The treatments used for arrhythmias include: medication \u2013 to stop or prevent an arrhythmia or control the rate of an arrhythmia cardioversion \u2013 a treatment that uses electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm while you are anaesthetised or sedated catheter ablation \u2013 a keyhole treatment under local or general anaesthetic that carefully destroys the diseased tissue in your heart that causes the arrhythmia pacemaker \u2013 a small device containing its own battery that is implanted in your chest under local anaesthetic; it produces electrical signals to do the work of the natural pacemaker in your heart to help it beat at a normal rate ICD \u2013 a device similar to a pacemaker that monitors your heart rhythm and shocks your heart back into a normal rhythm whenever this is needed ","Staying safe with an arrhythmia":"If you have an arrhythmia that affects your driving, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). If your job involves working at height or with machinery that could be dangerous, you will need to stop work at least until your arrhythmia is diagnosed or you get treatment for your underlying condition.

The most effective way to diagnose an arrhythmia is with an electrical recording of your heart rhythm called an electrocardiogram (ECG). If the ECG doesn't find a problem, you may need further monitoring of your heart. This may involve wearing a small portable ECG recording device for 24 hours or longer. This is called a Holter monitor or ambulatory ECG monitoring. If your symptoms seem to be triggered by exercise, an exercise ECG may be needed to record your heart rhythm while you are using a treadmill or exercise bike. You should request a copy of your ECG. Take it with you to see the cardiologist or heart rhythm specialist and always keep a copy for future use. Other tests used in diagnosing arrhythmias include: cardiac event recorder \u2013 a device to record occasional symptoms over a period of time whenever you have them electrophysiological (EP) study \u2013 a test to locate problems with the electrical signals in your heart by passing soft wires up a vein in your leg and into your heart while you are sedated echocardiogram (echo) \u2013 an ultrasound scan of your heart ","Support services":"Find heart disease information and support services Find atrial fibrillation services Find pacemaker implantation services ","URL":"/conditions/arrhythmia"},"Title":"Arrhythmia"},"Gout":{"Treatment":{"Treating gout ":"Treatment for gout includes pain relief to help you cope with a gout attack, as well as medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks. ","Pain relief for a gout attack":"You should: take any medication you've been prescribed as early as possible after you notice an attack (see below) \u2013 this should start to have an effect within two or three days rest and raise the limb avoid knocking or damaging the affected joint keep the joint cool \u2013 remove surrounding clothing and apply an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel ensure you're well hydrated Apply the ice pack to your joint for around 20 minutes. Don't apply ice directly to your skin and don't apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin. If necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during an attack, but you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually recommended as the first treatment for gout. They work by reducing pain and inflammation during an attack. NSAIDs used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib. If you've been prescribed NSAIDs, it's a good idea to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. Continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards. Your GP may also prescribe a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to take alongside your NSAID. This reduces the risk of the NSAID causing indigestion, stomach ulcers and bleeding from the stomach. If you're unable to take NSAIDs or if NSAIDs are ineffective, a medicine called colchicine can be used instead. Colchicine reduces some of the swelling and pain associated with a gout attack. It's best to have it with you at all times so you can use it at the first sign of a gout attack. Your GP will tell you how long to take it for and how often. When taken in high doses, side effects of colchicine include feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain and diarrhoea. Corticosteroids are sometimes used to treat severe cases of gout if other treatments don't work or you're unable to take an NSAID or colchicine. A short course of steroid tablets often provides relief, but they can't be used long-term in high doses as they cause side effects, including:  weight gain thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) easy bruising muscle weakness Corticosteroids can also be given by injection to provide rapid pain relief. This can be either into a muscle, a vein or directly into the affected joint.  ","Medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks":"You can reduce your chances of having further gout attacks by taking medication and making lifestyle changes to reduce the level of uric acid in your body. Medication to reduce uric acid levels \u2013 known as urate-lowering therapy (ULT) \u2013 is usually recommended if you have recurrent attacks of gout or you have complications of gout. Most people with gout will eventually need to have ULT, so you may want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment with your doctor as soon as you've been diagnosed with gout. They should explain that while ULT can significantly reduce your risk of having further attacks, the medication needs to be taken on a daily basis for the rest of your life and there's a small risk of side effects. If you decide to start ULT, a medicine called allopurinol is usually tried first. If this isn't suitable or doesn't work, other medications may be used instead. These medications are described below. Allopurinol helps reduce the production of uric acid. It can help prevent gout attacks, although it won't help relieve symptoms during an attack. Allopurinol is a tablet taken once a day. When you first start taking it, your dose will be adjusted to make sure the level of uric acid in your blood is low enough. Regular blood tests will be needed to monitor this until the most effective dose is found. Allopurinol can sometimes cause a gout attack soon after you start taking it and it can take up to a year or two before no further attacks occur. It's important to persevere with treatment even if you do have attacks during this time. To help relieve attacks, your doctor will prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described above to take alongside your allopurinol at first. Most people taking allopurinol won't experience any significant side effects. However, side effects can include: a rash \u2013 this is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of an allergy; if you develop a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your GP for advice indigestion headaches diarrhoea Like allopurinol, febuxostat is a medication taken once a day that reduces the body's production of uric acid. It's often used if allopurinol isn't suitable or causes troublesome side effects. As with allopurinol, febuxostat can make your symptoms worse when you first start taking it. Your doctor will initially prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described in case you experience attacks. Side effects of febuxostat can include: diarrhoea feeling sick headaches a rash Less commonly used ULT medications include benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone. These types of medication tend to only be used if people are unable to take allopurinol or febuxostat. They need to be prescribed under the supervision of a specialist. Certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of experiencing further attacks of gout, including: avoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of uric acid), such as red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract \u2013 see the gout and diet leaflet (PDF, 1Mb) produced by the UK Gout Society avoiding sugary drinks and snacks \u2013 these are associated with an increased risk of gout maintaining a healthy weight \u2013 follow a balanced diet; don't crash diet or try high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets taking regular exercise \u2013 try activities that don't put too much strain on your joints, such as swimming drinking plenty of water \u2013 keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints cutting down on alcohol \u2013 avoid beer and spirits in particular and don't binge drink There's some evidence to suggest that taking regular vitamin C supplements can reduce gout attacks, although the effect may only be small. Talk to your GP first if you're thinking about taking vitamin C supplements, as they aren't suitable or safe for everyone.

These can include: kidney stones small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi permanent joint damage Read more about the complications of gout. ","Introduction ":"Gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling. It's estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK are affected by gout. The condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause. Overall, gout is more common in men than women. Gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks. ","What's pseudogout?":"Pseudogout is a similar condition to gout, but usually affects the knee joint first. It's a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints - commonly the knee or wrist.  Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","Signs and symptoms of gout":"Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers. Signs and symptoms of gout include: severe pain in one or more joints the joint feeling hot and very tender swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected joint   Symptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal. Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year. Read more about the symptoms of gout. ","What causes gout?":"Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood. If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don't filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful.

These crystals also often build up under the skin and form small white or yellow lumps known as tophi. Tophi are usually painless, but they can form in awkward places, such as at the ends of your fingers and around your toes. Sometimes they can make everyday tasks such as preparing food or getting dressed difficult. They can also can become inflamed and produce a toothpaste-like discharge. Tophi can develop anywhere in the body, but usually form on the: toes heels knees fingers ears forearms elbows It normally takes several years after the first attack of gout for tophi to develop, but some people develop them even before experiencing an attack. They're usually a sign of severe gout and a good reason to start treatment to reduce the level or uric acid in your body. Successful treatment will prevent the tophi from getting any bigger, and long term treatment often gradually shrinks them. If you have very large or painful tophi, they may have to be surgically removed. ","Joint damage":"Without treatment, gout attacks may become more frequent and prolonged, and your likelihood of developing permanent joint damage will increase. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required to repair or replace a damaged joint. ","URL":"/conditions/Gout","Complications of gout ":"Complications of gout can include small lumps forming under the skin (tophi), joint damage and kidney stones. These are more likely to occur if gout is left untreated. ","Kidney stones":"Occasionally, high levels of uric acid can lead to the formation of kidney stones. Some kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pass urine, and can make you feel that you need to pass urine more often. Some kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pee, and can make you feel that you need to pee more often. You may be prescribed medication to make your urine less acidic, which should help dissolve any kidney stones that have developed. Read more about treating kidney stones. "},"Causes":{"Causes of gout ":"Gout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints, resulting in severe pain, tenderness and swelling. These crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in the body. ","What can increase your risk?":"A high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. However, it's still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout, while others with an equally high level don't. Other factors that may increase your risk of developing gout are outlined below. Some underlying medical conditions can increase your risk of developing gout, including: high blood pressure diabetes kidney disease high levels of fat and cholesterol in your blood obesity metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity) psoriasis (a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales) osteoarthritis Certain medications can increase your uric acid levels and your risk of developing gout. These include: diuretics (water tablets) \u2013 used to treat high blood pressure or an abnormal build-up of fluid in your body certain medicines used to treat high blood pressure \u2013 including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors low-dose aspirin \u2013 used to reduce the risk of blood clots niacin \u2013 used to treat high cholesterol ciclosporin \u2013 used to treat conditions such as psoriasis some chemotherapy medicines Uric acid is created when the body breaks down purines. Eating foods that contain a high level of purines can increase your risk of gout. Foods naturally high in purines include: red meat \u2013 such as beef, lamb and pork  seafood \u2013 especially shellfish and oily fish offal \u2013 such as liver, kidneys and heart Alcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood. Beer, fortified wines like port, and spirits do this more than wine. Moderate consumption of wine \u2013 one or two glasses a day \u2013 shouldn't significantly increase your risk of gout. Certain sugary drinks may also increase your risk of gout. Some research has found that drinking sugar-sweetened soft drinks and drinks with high levels of fructose (a naturally occurring sugar found in many fruits) had an increased risk of gout. Studies have shown that gout often runs in families. Around one in five people with gout have a close family member with the condition. Page last reviewed: 24/09/2015 Next review due: 31/03/2018 ","Uric acid":"Uric acid is created when the body breaks down chemicals known as purines. If your kidneys don't filter out enough uric acid, or your body is producing unusually high levels of it, it can build up in the body and turn into microscopic crystals. These crystals usually form in and around the joints, possibly because the temperature in these areas is slightly lower than the rest of the body. If they get into the space between joints, the crystals can cause painful inflammation (redness and swelling). ","URL":"/conditions/Gout"},"Title":"Gout","Diagnosis":{"URL":"/conditions/Gout","Diagnosing gout ":"Your GP may suspect gout based on your symptoms. Sometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes. ","Seeing your GP":"See your GP if you experience symptoms of gout for the first time. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis. They may also ask you about your diet, particularly your intake of beer, spirits and foods high in purines, such as red meat and seafood. ","Further tests":"Many conditions can cause gout-like symptoms. Your GP may be unable to make a firm diagnosis straight away and you may be referred for further tests. These will either confirm the diagnosis of gout or rule out other conditions. A sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint. The fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout, and it can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis. A blood test known as a serum uric acid test may be used to measure the amount of uric acid in your blood. A high level or uric acid is often associated with gout. It\u2019s sometimes best to wait until two to four weeks after an attack of gout before this test is carried out, as the level of uric acid in your blood is often not raised at the time of an attack. This is because the level of uric acid in your blood can drop when uric acid crystals form in the joints. An X-ray is rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn't usually detectable using this method. However, an X-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, such as chondrocalcinosis (a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints) or to assess whether there has been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent attacks of gout. An ultrasound scan of an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that's increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. It can also detect crystals deep in the skin that aren't obvious during a physical examination.

The joints towards the ends of the limbs tend to be affected more often, including the: toes \u2013 particularly the big toe joint midfoot (where your shoelaces sit) ankles  knees fingers wrists elbows If gout is left untreated, it's likely to affect more joints over time. ","Pattern of symptoms":"Attacks of gout tend to: occur at night, although they can happen at any time develop quickly over a few hours last between three and 10 days \u2013 after this time, the affected joint should start to return to normal, but the problem can persist if treatment isn't started early come back \u2013 you may experience attacks every few months or years become more frequent over time if not treated It's difficult to predict how often attacks will occur and when exactly they will happen.

This may lead to a build-up of fluid inside the body's cells, which can be potentially dangerous. This side effect occurs because SSRIs can block the effects of a hormone that helps to regulate levels of sodium and fluid in the body. Elderly people are vulnerable because fluid levels become more difficult for the body to regulate. Mild hyponatremia can cause symptoms similar to depression or side effects of SSRIs, such as: feeling sick headache muscle pain reduced appetite confusion More severe hyponatremia can cause the following symptoms: feeling listless and tired disorientation agitation psychosis seizures (fits) The most serious cases of hyponatremia can cause you to stop breathing or go into a coma. If you suspect that you or someone in your care has mild hyponatremia, call your GP for advice and stop taking SSRIs for the time being. If you suspect severe hyponatremia, call 999 to request an ambulance. Hyponatremia can be treated by feeding a sodium solution into the body through an intravenous drip. ","Serotonin syndrome":"Serotonin syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially serious, set of side effects linked to SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome occurs when the levels of a chemical in your brain called serotonin become too high. It's usually triggered when you take an SSRI in combination with another medication (or substance) that also raises serotonin levels, such as another antidepressant or St John\u2019s wort. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome can include: confusion agitation muscle twitching sweating shivering diarrhoea If you experience the symptoms listed above, you should stop taking the medication and seek immediate advice from your GP or specialist. If this isn't possible, call NHS 111.

They're mainly prescribed to treat depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. As well as depression, SSRIs can be used to treat a number of other mental health conditions, including: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) panic disorder severe phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia bulimia post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) SSRIs can sometimes be used to treat other conditions, such as premature ejaculation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain. ","Doses and duration of treatment":"SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. SSRIs usually need to be taken for two to four weeks before the benefit is felt. You may experience mild side effects early on, but it's important that you don't stop taking the medication. These effects will usually wear off quickly. If you take an SSRI for four to six weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. A course of treatment usually lasts for at least six months, although longer courses are sometimes recommended and some people with recurrent problems may be advised to take them indefinitely. Read more about SSRI doses. ","How SSRIs work":"It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as \"reuptake\"). SSRIs work by blocking (\"inhibiting\") reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT. ","URL":"/conditions/SSRIs-(selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors)","Types of SSRIs":"There are currently seven SSRIs prescribed in the UK: citalopram (Cipramil) dapoxetine (Priligy) escitalopram (Cipralex) fluoxetine (Prozac or Oxactin) fluvoxamine (Faverin) paroxetine (Seroxat) sertraline (Lustral) You can find more information and advice about these SSRIs on the Medicines Complete website. Page last reviewed: 20/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 "},"Title":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)","Dosage":{"Stopping SSRIs":"You shouldn't suddenly stop taking SSRIs, even if you feel better. Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as: stomach upsets flu-like symptoms  anxiety dizziness sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks seizures (fits) If your GP or mental health specialist decides to stop your course of SSRIs, they'll reduce the dose gradually over a few weeks. Page last reviewed: 20/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Missed or extra doses":"It's important not to miss any of your doses, because this could make your treatment less effective. If you do miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time to take your next dose, in which case you should just skip the missed dose. Don't take a double dose to \"make up\" for the one you missed. If you take more tablets than prescribed, contact your GP as soon as possible for advice. If this isn't possible, contact your local out of hours service, or call NHS 111. Taking a double dose is unlikely to be harmful, but you should only do so if advised by a medical professional. ","About your SSRI dose  ":"When prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), your doctor will usually select the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of side effects. If the prescribed dose proves ineffective, it can be gradually increased. SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. Depending on the type of SSRI prescribed and the severity of your depression, you'll usually have to take one to three tablets a day. It will usually take two to four weeks before you begin to notice the effects of SSRIs. You'll have regular meetings with your doctor when you first start taking SSRIs and you should let them know if you haven't noticed any improvement after four to six weeks. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. It's usually recommended that a course of SSRIs lasts at least six months to prevent your condition recurring when you stop. However, if you've experienced previous episodes of depression, a two-year course may be recommended. Some people with recurring problems are advised to carry on taking medication indefinitely. ","URL":"/conditions/SSRIs-(selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors)"},"Cautions":{"Pregnancy":"As a precaution, SSRIs aren't usually recommended during pregnancy, particularly during the first three months (the first trimester). This is because there may be a risk to the baby. However, exceptions can be made if the risk posed by depression (or another mental health condition) outweighs the potential risks of treatment. Possible risks of taking SSRIs during pregnancy include: loss of the pregnancy birth defects affecting the baby\u2019s heart (congenital heart disease) the baby being born with a rare condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN), which causes breathing and circulation problems However, it isn't clear whether SSRIs definitely cause these complications. Most experts think that if SSRIs do increase the risks of complications during pregnancy, the increase is probably small. If you're pregnant and think you may be depressed, you should discuss the risks and benefits of using SSRIs with your doctor. If SSRIs are recommended, you'll usually be prescribed fluoxetine, citalopram or sertraline because these are thought to be relatively safe to use. You should also speak to your doctor for advice if you become pregnant while you're taking SSRIs. ","Interactions with other medications":"SSRIs can react unpredictably with certain other medications (known as \"interacting\"), potentially increasing the risk of side effects such as bleeding or a problem known as \"serotonin syndrome\". Read more about the side effects of SSRIs. Some of the medications that can interact with some SSRIs include: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 a common type of painkiller that includes ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen antiplatelets \u2013 a type of medication used to prevent blood clots, such as low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel theophylline \u2013 a medication used to treat asthma clozapine and pimozide \u2013 medications used to treat schizophrenia and psychosis lithium \u2013 a medication used to treat severe depression and bipolar disorder triptans \u2013 a type of medication, such as naratriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, used to treat migraines  other antidepressants \u2013 including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) However, this isn't an exhaustive list of all the medications that can interact with SSRIs, and not all of these interactions apply to all types of SSRI. You should always make sure you carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medication to see if there are any medications you should avoid. If in doubt, your pharmacist or GP should be able to advise you. ","Medical conditions":"SSRIs may not be suitable if you have any of the following conditions: bipolar disorder and you're in a manic phase (a period of extremely excitable mood), although they can be useful for depressive phases a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes epilepsy \u2013 SSRIs should only be taken if your epilepsy is well controlled, and they should be stopped if your epilepsy gets worse narrow angle glaucoma serious kidney, liver or heart problems SSRIs may need to be used with caution or not at all if you have one of these conditions, because the medication could increase your chance of experiencing serious side effects. ","Interactions with food and drink":"Alcohol isn't usually recommended if you're taking an SSRI, because it can increase any drowsiness you may experience and can make feelings of depression worse. The SSRI, fluvoxamine, is also known to enhance the effects of caffeine, so people who drink large amounts of caffeine may experience unpleasant symptoms such as palpitations, feeling sick, restlessness and insomnia. You should therefore avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee, energy drinks and cola, while taking fluvoxamine. ","Driving and operating machinery":"Some SSRIs can cause dizziness, drowsiness and blurred vision, particularly when you first start taking them. If you experience these problems, you should avoid driving or using heavy tools and machinery. ","Children and young people":"SSRIs aren't usually recommended for children and young people under the age of 18. This is because there's evidence of an increased risk of self-harm and thoughts about suicide in this age group. There are also concerns that the use of SSRIs could affect brain development in children and young people. However, children and young people under the age of 18 may be offered an SSRI if talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), alone haven't helped. In such cases, an SSRI will only be prescribed in addition to a talking therapy and treatment must be supervised by a psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions). If an SSRI is recommended, fluoxetine is usually the first choice. ","Cautions and interactions ":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aren't suitable for everyone. They can cause problems if you have other health conditions or if they're taken alongside other medications. Some of the issues you and your doctor will need to bear in mind when taking SSRIs, or when considering using them, are described below. ","Breastfeeding":"As a precaution, SSRIs aren't usually recommended if you're breastfeeding. This is because the medication may be passed to your baby in your breast milk. However, SSRIs may be used if it's thought that the benefits of treatment and benefits of breastfeeding your baby outweigh the potential risks. If you're prescribed SSRIs when breastfeeding, paroxetine or sertraline are usually recommended. ","St John\u2019s wort":"St John\u2019s wort is a popular herbal remedy promoted for the treatment of depression. While there's some evidence that St John's wort may help mild to moderate depression, many experts advise against using it because the amount of active ingredient can vary significantly and you can never be sure what sort of effect it will have on you. Taking St John's wort alongside SSRIs can also potentially cause serious health problems.

You may be going through a particularly stressful period of your life. There may have been illness or death in your family, or another family member may have worried a lot about your health when you were young. Personality can be a factor. You may be vulnerable to health anxiety because you are a worrier generally. You may find it difficult to handle emotions and conflict, and tend to \"catastrophise\" when faced with problems in your life. Sometimes, health anxiety can be a symptom of a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety disorder, which needs recognising and treating in its own right (see below). ","Health anxiety can be a vicious circle":"If you constantly check your body for signs of illness, such as a rash or bump, you will eventually find something. It often won't be anything serious \u2013 it could be a natural body change, or you could be misinterpreting signs of anxiety (such as increased heart rate and sweating) as signs of a serious condition. However, the discovery tends to cause great anxiety and make you self-check even more. You may find yourself needing more reassurance from doctors, friends and family. The comfort you get from this reassurance may be short-lived, or you may stop believing it, which only means you need more of it to feel better. Seeking reassurance just keeps the symptoms in your head, and usually makes you feel worse. When physical symptoms are triggered or made worse by worrying, it causes even more anxiety, which just worsens the symptoms. Excessive worrying can also lead to panic attacks or even depression. ","Have I got health anxiety?":"If you can answer \"yes\" to most of the following questions, it's likely that you are affected by health anxiety and might benefit from talking to your GP. During the past six months: Have you been preoccupied with having a serious illness because of body symptoms, which has lasted at least six months? Have you felt distressed due to this preoccupation? Have you found that this preoccupation impacts negatively on all areas of life, including family life, social life and work? Have you needed to carry out constant self-examination and self-diagnosis? Have you experienced disbelief over a diagnosis from a doctor, or felt you are unconvinced by your doctor's reassurances that you are fine? Do you constantly need reassurance from doctors, family and friends that you are fine, even if you don't really believe what you are being told? ","Introduction ":"Most of us worry about our health from time to time, and some of us have to manage serious medical conditions. But for some people, health worries become overwhelming and a problem in itself. Health anxiety (sometimes called hypochondria) is excessive worrying about your health, to the point where it causes great distress and affects your everyday life. Some people with health anxiety have a medical condition, which they worry about excessively. Others have medically unexplained symptoms, such as chest pain or headaches, which they are concerned may be a sign of a serious illness, despite the doctor's reassurance. Others may be permanently anxious about their future health, worrying about things like: \"What if I get cancer or heart disease?\" ","How your GP can help":"Once your GP has established that you do suffer from health anxiety, and there is no serious underlying physical cause for any symptoms you might have, they should investigate whether you might have a problem, such as depression or anxiety disorder, that may be causing or worsening your symptoms.  If this is the case, you may be referred for psychological therapy and you may benefit from antidepressants (see below). If this is not the case, the aim should still be to help you become less worried about your health. You may find that your GP's advice and self-help resources (see below) are all you need to start feeling better, or you may still benefit from a referral for psychological therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for many people with health anxiety. It involves working with a trained CBT therapist to identify the thoughts and emotions you experience and the things you do to cope with them, with the aim of changing unhealthy thoughts and behaviours that maintain health anxiety. CBT looks at how to challenge the way you interpret symptoms, to encourage a more balanced and realistic view. It should help you to: learn what seems to make the symptoms worse develop methods of coping with the symptoms keep yourself more active, even if you still have symptoms However, CBT is not the best treatment for everyone with health anxiety. Some people may benefit more from a different psychological therapy, such as trauma-focused therapy or a psychotherapy that will help a particular psychological condition. Accurate assessment is needed to select the right treatment for you and for your problem, so, if necessary, you may be referred to a mental health specialist for this next step.  Antidepressants may be helpful if you have a mental health condition such as depression. For some people, these may work better than CBT. Your GP can directly prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a mental health specialist for treatment. However, treating your symptoms with medication is not always the answer and the possible benefits of medication always need to be weighed against the potential negative effects. There's lots you can do to help yourself. A good first step would be to read the NHS Health Anxiety leaflet, which can be downloaded from the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS website. This is just one of many self-help guides available. It provides advice and exercises you can try yourself, such as keeping a diary of your preoccupations and symptoms, and counteracting them with realistic and rational thinking. Page last reviewed: 13/01/2015 Next review due: 29/11/2017 ","Types of health anxiety":"People with health anxiety can fall into one of two extremes: Constantly seeking information and reassurance \u2013 for example, obsessively researching illnesses from the internet, booking frequent GP appointments, and having frequent tests that don't find any problems. Avoidant behaviour \u2013 avoiding medical TV programmes, GP appointments and anything else that might trigger the anxiety, and avoiding activities such as exercise that are perceived to make the condition worse. Neither of these behaviours are helpful, and need addressing if you are to break the vicious circle of health anxiety.

Don't go near sick or dead birds. Keep away from bird droppings if possible and wash your hands thoroughly if you accidentally touch any. Call the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) helpline on 08459 33 55 77 if you find five or more dead birds in the same place. If you come across between one and four dead birds, Defra advises leaving them alone or disposing of them carefully. See the Defra website for guidelines on disposing of dead birds. ","Pets":"In general, you don't need to change the way you look after your pets. If you have a dog that sometimes catches wild birds, try to avoid areas where this is likely to happen. In theory, the H5N1 bird flu strain can be passed on to other animals, but it's very unlikely. If you have a pet bird, you should avoid letting it have any contact with wild birds or wild bird droppings. ","Travel":"If you're travelling in a country that's had an outbreak of bird flu, don't go to live animal markets or poultry farms. Don't go near bird droppings or dead birds, and don't bring live birds or poultry products back to the UK with you, including feathers. The NHS has plans in place to manage a potential outbreak of bird flu in the UK, although such an outbreak is considered highly unlikely. ","General precautions":"To reduce your risk of catching and passing on viral infections, such as flu, always ensure you: wash your hands regularly, particularly before and after handling food turn away from other people and cover your mouth with tissues when you cough or sneeze dispose of tissues immediately after use and wash your hands with soap and warm water avoid public places if you're ill  tell the receptionist at your GP surgery about your symptoms so you can be seated away from other people and given a surgical mask if necessary make sure you maintain a good level of general health and have any recommended vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccination and seasonal flu vaccine, if you're in a high-risk group \u2013 for example, if you have a long-term illness such as asthma or you're 65 or over ","Preventing bird flu ":"As the bird flu (avian flu) virus is carried by birds, it's very difficult to prevent it spreading. However, there are some general measures you can take to reduce your risk of catching a viral infection. ","Bird flu vaccination":"A vaccine that offers protection against the H5N1 bird flu strain does exist, but supplies are limited, so it's unlikely to be widely available unless there's a serious outbreak. The seasonal flu vaccine doesn't provide protection against the strains of bird flu that can affect humans.

","URL":"/conditions/Avian-flu"},"Introduction":{"Human cases":"The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that by May 2015, 840 people had been infected with the H5N1 virus worldwide and 447 had died. Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam experienced most cases and fatalities. Since March 2013, there have been reports of people being infected with the H7N9 virus, mostly in the southeastern part of mainland China. By May 2015, there had been 665 confirmed cases and 229 deaths. Most cases were among middle-aged to elderly men. A small number of cases were reported in travellers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Canada. For both viruses, there have been some reports of limited human to human transmission, usually as a result of very close contact between family members. People who have had bird flu generally developed the virus after coming into close and prolonged contact with infected birds. Millions of birds have been killed during outbreaks to prevent the disease spreading and being passed on to people. Page last reviewed: 28/05/2015 Next review due: 30/05/2018 ","Bird flu in the UK":"No humans have been infected with bird flu in the UK, although plans are in place to manage any suspected cases. A few cases of bird flu were confirmed in poultry in the UK recently. In February 2015, a low-severity H7N7 strain of bird flu was confirmed at a farm in Hampshire, but restrictions around the premises were lifted 21 days later after cleaning and disinfection. Before that, in November 2014, H5N8 bird flu was confirmed at a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the risk to public health was very low. This is because H5N8 infection was not found in humans during the recent worldwide epidemic among birds. The last reported case of H5N1 in the UK was in early 2008. You can read reports on recent cases of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. ","Signs and symptoms":"Like other types of flu, bird flu symptoms often include: a high temperature (fever) aching muscles headache respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early symptoms in some people. These symptoms can come on suddenly. The time from infection to the start of symptoms (incubation period) is usually three to five days, although in some cases it can be up to seven days. Within days of symptoms appearing, potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure may develop. Prompt treatment with antiviral medication may help prevent complications and reduce the risk of death. ","Introduction ":"Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. In rare cases, it can affect humans. There are many different strains of bird flu virus, most of which don't infect humans. However, two particular strains have caused serious concern in recent years: H5N1 (since 1997) H7N9 (since 2013) Although these viruses don't infect people easily and aren't usually transmitted from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. Other bird flu viruses \u2013 particularly H7N7 and H9N2, and more recently H6N1, H10N8 and H5N6 \u2013 have also infected people, but these have been very rare or only rarely caused severe illness. Bird flu affects many species of birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese. It can be passed between commercial, wild and pet birds. Birds don't always get sick from infection, so seemingly healthy birds may still pose a risk to people who come into contact with them. ","Treatment":"People with suspected symptoms of bird flu (avian flu) will be advised to stay at home, or will be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients. The main recommendations are: resting drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily taking medication to help treat fever and pain, such as aspirin and paracetamol In the UK, certain antiviral medications have been stockpiled for use in the event of an outbreak. These medications work by stopping the virus multiplying in your body. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir (Relenza) and Peramivir (Rapivab) help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. For regular flu, these medications are most effective if given within 48 hours of symptoms developing, but it's not clear if this is the case for bird flu. Nevertheless, they should be given as soon as possible to people suspected or proven to be infected, even if it's more than 48 hours after symptoms started. These medications may also be given as a preventative measure to people who could have been exposed to bird flu viruses \u2013 for example, other household members, healthcare workers, or people who have had close contact with infected birds. In these cases, the course of medication should begin as soon as possible after exposure to the virus and continue for 7 to 10 days after the last known exposure. Complications such as bacterial pneumonia may develop in some people and can be treated with regular antibiotics. People who are severely affected may need to be given extra oxygen to help them breathe \u2013 for example, through a ventilator (a machine that assists with breathing). ","How bird flu spreads to humans":"Bird flu is spread through direct contact with infected birds (dead or alive), an infected bird's droppings, or secretions from their eyes or respiratory tract. Close and prolonged contact with an infected bird is generally required for the infection to spread to humans. For example: touching infected birds that are dead or alive inhaling or being in contact with dried dust from the droppings or bedding of infected birds inhaling or being in contact with droplets sneezed by infected birds culling, slaughtering, butchering or preparing infected poultry for cooking Another possible source of bird flu can be live markets, where birds are sold in crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling in countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. Bird flu isn't transmitted through cooked food. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat in areas that have experienced outbreaks of bird flu. ","When to seek medical advice":"You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 immediately if you experience these symptoms and you've visited an area affected by bird flu in the last two weeks. An initial assessment can be made over the phone, at a GP surgery, at home, or in a side room at a hospital. Bird flu is diagnosed based on your symptoms and the likelihood that you've been exposed to an infected bird. The doctor will ask you whether you've: recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within one metre) to live or dead domestic fowl or wild birds, including those at bird markets had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and who was from an area that had an outbreak If bird flu is suspected, the following tests will be carried out to establish whether you have the infection: chest X-ray virus detection using a nose and throat swab blood tests If the laboratory tests and chest X-ray results are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu. You can read about outbreaks of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. ","Preventing bird flu":"There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk when you visit areas where outbreaks have been reported, such as: avoid visiting live animal markets and poultry farms avoid contact with surfaces that are contaminated with bird droppings don't pick up or touch birds (dead or alive) don't eat or handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes don't bring any live poultry products back to the UK, including feathers always practise good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly There are no restrictions on travel to countries that have been or are currently affected by bird flu.

Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. There are several types of EDS that may share some symptoms, including: an increased range of joint movement (joint hypermobility) stretchy skin fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily The different types of EDS are caused by faults in certain genes that make connective tissue weaker. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from one parent, or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene isn't inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. EDS can affect people in different ways. For some, the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. Some of the rare severe types can be life-threatening. This pages covers: Main types of EDS Getting medical advice Living with EDS How EDS is inherited Links to more information Hypermobile EDS is the most common type of EDS. Rarer types include classical EDS, vascular EDS and kyphoscoliotic EDS. ","Hypermobile EDS":"Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is often thought to be the same as or very similar to another condition called joint hypermobility syndrome. People with hEDS may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily joint pain and clicking joints extreme tiredness (fatigue) skin that bruises easily digestive problems, such as heartburn and constipation dizziness and an increased heart rate after standing up problems with internal organs, such as mitral valve prolapse or organ prolapse problems with bladder control (stress incontinence) Currently, there are no tests to confirm whether someone has hEDS. The diagnosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. ","Kyphoscoliotic EDS":"Kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS) is rare. People with kEDS may have: curvature of the spine \u2013 this starts in early childhood and often gets worse in the teenage years joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily weak muscle tone from childhood (hypotonia) \u2013 this may cause a delay in sitting and walking, or difficulty walking if symptoms get worse fragile eyes that can easily be damaged soft, velvety skin that is stretchy, bruises easily and scars See your GP if you have several troublesome symptoms of EDS. You don't usually need to worry if you only have a few symptoms and they're not causing any problems. Joint hypermobility, for example, is common in healthy people and is unlikely to be caused by EDS if you don't have any other symptoms. Your GP may refer you to a joint specialist (rheumatologist) if you have problems with your joints and they suspect EDS. If there's a possibility you may have one of the rare types of EDS, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service for an assessment. The local genetics specialist will ask about your medical history, family history, assess your symptoms and may carry out a genetic blood test to confirm the diagnosis. If further investigation is needed, your hospital doctor can refer you to a specialist EDS diagnostic service based in Sheffield and London. There's no specific treatment for EDS, but with support and advice it's possible to manage many of the symptoms. ","Vascular EDS":"Vascular EDS (vEDS) is a rare type of EDS and is often considered to be the most serious. It affects the blood vessels and internal organs, which can cause them to split open and lead to life-threatening bleeding. People with vEDS may have: skin that bruises very easily thin skin with visible small blood vessels, particularly on the upper chest and legs  fragile blood vessels that can bulge or tear, resulting in serious internal bleeding a risk of organ problems, such as the bowel tearing, the womb tearing (in late pregnancy) and partial collapse of the lung hypermobile fingers and toes, unusual facial features, (such as a thin nose and lips, large eyes and small earlobes), varicose veins and delayed wound healing ","Specialist support":"People with EDS may also benefit from support from a number of different healthcare professionals. For example: a physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints, avoid injuries and manage pain an occupational therapist can help you manage daily activities and give advice on equipment that may help you counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be useful if you're struggling to cope with long-term pain for certain types of EDS, regular scans carried out in hospital can detect problems with internal organs genetic counselling can help you learn more about the cause of your condition, how it's inherited, and what the risks are of passing it on to your children (see below) Your GP or consultant can refer you to these services. EDS can be inherited, but in some cases it occurs by chance in someone without a family history of the condition. The two main ways EDS is inherited are: autosomal dominant inheritance (hypermobile, classical and vascular EDS) \u2013 the faulty gene that causes EDS is passed on by one parent and there's a 50% risk of each of their children developing the condition autosomal recessive inheritance (kyphoscoliotic EDS) \u2013 the faulty gene is inherited from both parents and there's a 25% risk of each of their children developing the condition A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children. For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS can't inherit vascular EDS. The severity of the condition can vary within the same family.

People with cEDS may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily stretchy skin fragile skin that can split easily \u2013 especially over the forehead, knees, shins and elbows smooth, velvety skin that bruises easily wounds that are slow to heal and leave wide scars hernias and organ prolapse ","URL":"/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome","Adapting your activities":"It's important to be careful about activities that put a lot of strain on your joints or put you at risk of injury. However, it's also important not to be overprotective and avoid living an otherwise normal life. Advice will depend on which type of EDS you have and how it affects you. you may be advised to avoid some activities entirely, such as heavy lifting and contact sports for some activities, you may need to wear appropriate protection and be taught how to reduce the strain on your joints lower-risk activities, such as swimming or pilates, may be recommended to help you stay fit and healthy if fatigue is a problem, you can be taught ways to conserve your energy and pace your activities For more tips and advice on joint care, you can read about living with EDS on the Ehlers-Danlos Support UK website. "},"Title":"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes"},"Arthroscopy":{"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"An arthroscopy is a type of keyhole surgery used both to diagnose and treat problems with joints. It's most commonly used on the knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, wrists and hips. An arthroscopy involves the use of a device called an arthroscope to examine the joints. This is a thin, metal tube about the length and width of a drinking straw that contains a light source and a camera. Images are sent from the arthroscope to a video screen or an eyepiece, so the surgeon is able to see inside the joint. It's also possible for tiny surgical instruments to be used alongside an arthroscope to allow the surgeon to treat certain joint conditions. As the equipment used during an arthroscopy is so small, only minor cuts need to be made in the skin. This means the procedure has some potential advantages over traditional, \"open\" surgery, including: less pain after the operation  faster healing time lower risk of infection you can often go home the same day you may be able to return to normal activities more quickly ","Why it's used":"An arthroscopy might be recommended if you have problems such as persistent joint pain, swelling or stiffness, and scans have not been able to identify the cause. An arthroscopy can also be used to treat a range of joint problems and conditions. For example, it can be used to: repair damaged cartilage remove fragments of loose bone or cartilage drain away any excess fluid treat conditions such as arthritis, frozen shoulder or carpal tunnel syndrome Read more about when an arthroscopy may be used. ","Recovering from an arthroscopy":"The time it takes to recover from an arthroscopy can vary, depending on the joint involved and the specific procedure you had. It's often possible to return to work and light, physical activities within a few weeks, but more demanding physical activities such as lifting and sport may not be possible for several months. Your surgeon or care team will advise you how long it's likely to take to fully recover and what activities you should avoid until you're feeling better. While you're recovering, you should contact your surgical team or GP for advice if you think you may have developed one of the complications mentioned below. Read more about recovering from an arthroscopy. ","What are the risks?":"An arthroscopy is generally considered to be a safe procedure, but like all types of surgery it does carry some risks. It's normal to experience short-lived problems such as swelling, bruising, stiffness and discomfort after an arthroscopy. These will usually improve during the days or weeks following the procedure. More serious problems are much less common, occurring in less than 1 in 100 cases. They include: a blood clot that develops in one of the limbs \u2013 this is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and it can cause pain and swelling in the affected limb infection inside the joint \u2013 this is known as septic arthritis and it can cause a high temperature (fever), pain and swelling in the joint bleeding inside the joint \u2013 which often causes severe pain and swelling accidental damage to the nerves that are near the joint \u2013 this can lead to numbness and some loss of sensation, which may be temporary or permanent Speak to your surgeon about the possible risks before agreeing to have an arthroscopy. Page last reviewed: 27/04/2015 Next review due: 27/04/2017 ","URL":"/conditions/Arthroscopy","What happens during an arthroscopy?":"The arthroscope is inserted through a small cut in the skin made next to the joint. Further small incisions may also be made to allow an examining probe or surgical instruments to be inserted. Your surgeon will then examine the inside of the joint using the arthroscope and, if necessary, remove or repair any problem areas. This will usually be done under general anaesthetic, although sometimes a spinal or local anaesthetic is used. The procedure is usually performed as a day case, which means you'll normally be able to go home on the same day as the surgery. Read more about how an arthroscopy is performed. "},"When it's used":{"When an arthroscopy may be used ":"An arthroscopy can be carried out to help diagnose and treat a number of joint problems and conditions. ","Diagnosing joint problems":"An arthroscopy can be used to help investigate: joint pain joint stiffness swelling of the joint the joint giving way or \"popping\" out of position These problems are usually first investigated using X-rays, computerised tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. If these scans don't find anything, it may be necessary to take a direct look at the inside of the joint. An arthroscopy can also be used to assess the level of joint damage resulting from an injury, such as a sports injury, or from underlying conditions that can cause joint damage, such as osteoarthritis. ","Treating joint problems and conditions":"Fine surgical instruments can be used along with an arthroscope to allow a surgeon to treat a range of joint problems and conditions. For example, an arthroscopy can be used to: repair damaged cartilage, tendons and ligaments (for example, in knee ligament surgery) remove inflamed tissue remove small sections of bone and cartilage that have broken off and are loose within the joint drain away an excess build-up of synovial fluid (which lubricates the joint) Conditions that can be treated with arthroscopy include: arthritis \u2013 a common condition that causes pain and inflammation within a joint Baker's cyst \u2013 a build-up of synovial fluid inside a joint, leading to stiffness and swelling frozen shoulder \u2013 pain and stiffness in the shoulder that tends to get gradually worse carpal tunnel syndrome \u2013 a tingling sensation, numbness and sometimes pain in the hand and fingers arthrofibrosis \u2013 excess scar tissue caused by a previous injury that disrupts the normal workings of the joint bone spurs \u2013 abnormal bone growths that can cause persistent pain synovitis \u2013 inflammation of the joint lining temporomandibular disorder (TMD) \u2013 a problem that affects the joint between the lower jaw and the base of the skull Page last reviewed: 27/04/2015 Next review due: 27/04/2017 ","URL":"/conditions/Arthroscopy"},"Title":"Arthroscopy","Recovery":{"After the operation":"After your arthroscopy, you'll be taken to a room to recover from the effects of the general anaesthetic, if it was used during the procedure. You may experience some pain in the joint. If you do, tell a member of the hospital staff, who will be able to give you painkillers. Most people who have an arthroscopy are able to leave hospital either on the day of the surgery or the following morning. Before leaving hospital, you may have an appointment with a physiotherapist to discuss exercises for you to do at home. Depending on the type of procedure you had, you may need a temporary sling, splint or crutches to support and protect the joint while you recover. Some people are given special pumps or compression bandages to help improve their blood flow. ","Recovering from an arthroscopy ":"How long it takes to recover after an arthroscopy can vary, depending on the type of surgery you had, your general health and the type of work that you do. Some people feel better after a few days, while others may not be back to normal for several months. ","Returning to normal activities":"Your surgeon or care team will advise you how long it's likely to take to fully recover and what activities you should avoid until you're feeling better. You'll probably need at least a week or two off work, although this varies from person to person \u2013 some need more, while others need less. This will largely depend on whether your job involves strenuous activity that could damage the joint. You'll be able to drive again once you're able to do so without experiencing any pain and you can safely perform an emergency stop. This may not be for a few weeks or several months after surgery. Your surgeon can give you more specific advice. Your surgeon can advise you on how long it will be before you can undertake strenuous physical activities, such as heavy lifting and sport. For many people, this will be around six weeks after surgery, but in some cases it may not be for several months. ","When to seek medical advice":"You should contact your GP or the clinic where you had your operation if you experience: a high temperature (fever) severe or increasing pain severe or increasing redness or swelling discoloured or foul-smelling discharge from your wounds numbness or tingling These problems could be a sign of a complication of surgery, such as an infection or nerve damage. Page last reviewed: 27/04/2015 Next review due: 27/04/2017 ","URL":"/conditions/Arthroscopy","Recovery advice":"It's likely that you'll feel tired and light-headed after having a general anaesthetic, so you'll need to ask a responsible adult to take you home and to stay with you for the first 24 hours following surgery. Most people will recover from the effects of the anaesthetic within 48 hours. Make sure you elevate the joint and apply ice packs to help with swelling when you get home, if advised to do so. You should also carry out any joint exercises that have been recommended for you. Any dressings will need to be kept as dry as possible, so you'll need to cover them with a plastic bag when having a bath or shower. If your dressings do get wet or fall off, they will need to be replaced. The dressings can usually be removed after 5 to 10 days. Your wounds should start to heal within a few days. If non-dissolvable stiches were used to close them, these will need to be removed after a week or two. This will usually be done by a practice nurse at your local GP surgery. You'll normally be asked to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after the operation to discuss the results of the surgery, your recovery, and any additional treatment you may require. "},"How it's performed":{"Preparing for surgery":"Before having an arthroscopy, you'll usually be given an appointment to attend a pre-admission clinic. During your appointment, your general health will be assessed to make sure you're ready for surgery. You'll also be given information about issues such as: what and when you are allowed to eat and drink on the day of surgery whether you should stop or start any medications before surgery how long it will take for you to recover from surgery whether you will need to do rehabilitation exercises after surgery The surgical team will explain the benefits and risks associated with having an arthroscopy. You will also be asked to sign a consent form to confirm that you agree to have the operation and that you understand what's involved, including the risks and benefits.  ","How an arthroscopy is carried out ":"An arthroscopy procedure usually lasts between 30 minutes and two hours. You can normally go home the same day or the following morning. ","The arthroscopy operation":"An arthroscopy is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, although occasionally it can be performed under spinal anaesthesia, or with local anaesthetic. Your anaesthetist will explain which type of anaesthetic is most suitable for you. In some cases, you may be able to express a preference. If you have a local anaesthetic, your joint will be numbed so you do not feel any pain. However, you may still feel some sensations during the procedure, such as a mild tugging, as the surgeon works on the joint. Antibacterial fluid is used to clean the skin over the affected joint and a small incision, a few millimetres long, is made so the arthroscope can be inserted. One or more additional incisions will also be made so that an examining probe or other fine surgical instruments can be inserted. The surgeon may fill the joint with a sterile fluid to expand it and make it easier to view. They will be able to see inside your joint using an eyepiece or a video screen. If possible, during the procedure, they will repair any damaged areas and remove any unwanted tissue. Your surgeon will then examine the inside of the joint using the arthroscope and, if necessary, remove or repair any problems areas using surgical instruments inserted through the additional incisions. After the procedure, the arthroscope and any attachments are removed, along with any excess fluid from the joint. The incisions are usually closed using special tape or stitches and covered with a sterile dressing. Read more about recovering from an arthroscopy.

However, you should see your GP if you have an anal fissure as they can give you advice and medications to help ease your symptoms and allow the fissure to heal more quickly. Most anal fissures will heal with treatment, although they can recur easily, particularly if you don't follow the self-help advice outlined below. There are a number of self-help measures your GP may recommend to relieve constipation and reduce the pain caused by anal fissures.  Relieving constipation can allow anal fissures to heal and reduce the chances of further fissures developing in the future. Self-help measures include: increasing your daily intake of fibre by including plenty of high-fibre foods in your diet, such as fruit, vegetables and wholegrains avoiding dehydration by drinking plenty of water trying to get more exercise \u2013 for example, by going for a daily walk or run working out a place and time of day when you can comfortably spend time on the toilet not delaying going to the toilet when you feel the urge if you use wet wipes, avoiding products that contain fragrance or alcohol as this could lead to discomfort or itching \u2013 if you use toilet paper, use a soft brand and avoid wiping too hard soaking your bottom in a warm bath several times a day, particularly after a bowel movement, to relax the muscles in your anus See preventing anal fissures for more self-help advice. There are a number of different medications your GP may recommend to help reduce your symptoms and allow your anal fissure to heal. ","Lateral sphincterotomy":"A lateral sphincterotomy involves making a small cut in the ring of muscle surrounding the anal canal (sphincter) to help reduce the tension in your anal canal. This allows the anal fissure to heal and reduces your chances of developing any more fissures. It is a short and relatively straightforward operation that's usually carried out under a general anaesthetic on a day patient basis. This means you'll be asleep while the procedure is carried out, but you won't usually have to spend the night in hospital. A lateral sphincterotomy is one of the most effective treatments for anal fissures, with a good track record of success. Most people will fully heal within two to four weeks. Less than 1 in 20 people who have this type of surgery will experience some temporary loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence) afterwards as a result of damage to the anal muscles. However, this is usually a mild type of incontinence where the person is unable to prevent passing wind, and usually only lasts a few weeks. ","Calcium channel blockers":"Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem, are a type of medication usually used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). However, topical calcium channel blockers that are applied directly to the anus have also proved useful in treating some people with anal fissures. Topical calcium channel blockers work by relaxing the sphincter muscle and increasing blood supply to the fissure. Side effects can include headaches, dizziness, and itchiness or burning at the site when you apply the medication. Any side effects should pass within a few days once your body gets used to the medication. Topical calcium channel blockers are thought to be about as effective as GTN ointment for treating anal fissures, and may be recommended if other medications haven't helped. As with GTN ointment, you'll usually have to use calcium channel blockers for at least six weeks, or until your fissure has completely healed. ","Botulinum toxin injections":"Botulinum toxin is a relatively new treatment for anal fissures. It's usually used if other medications haven't helped. Botulinum toxin is a powerful poison that's safe to use in small doses. If you have an anal fissure, an injection of the toxin can be used to paralyse your sphincter muscle. This should prevent the muscle from spasming, helping reduce pain and allowing the fissure to heal. It's not clear exactly how effective botulinum toxin injections are for anal fissures, but research suggests they're helpful for more than half the people who have them. This is similar to having treatment with GTN ointment and topical calcium channel blockers. The effects of botulinum toxin injections last for around two to three months, which should normally allow enough time for the fissure to heal. You may have a follow-up appointment a few weeks after starting your treatment. This will allow your GP to check your fissure has healed or is showing adequate signs of improvement. If the fissure has completely healed, your GP may recommend a further follow-up appointment a few weeks later. If your anal fissure is particularly severe or doesn't respond to treatment after eight weeks, you may have to be referred to a colorectal surgeon, a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the rectum and anus, for specialist treatment. This usually involves having some type of surgery. Surgery may be recommended if other treatments haven't worked.  It is generally considered to be the most effective treatment for anal fissures, with more than 90% of people experiencing good long-term results. However, it does carry a small risk of complications. There are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat anal fissures. The main techniques used are outlined below. ","Glyceryl trinitrate":"If your symptoms don't improve within a week or two, your GP may prescribe a medication called glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an ointment applied to the anal canal, usually twice a day. GTN works by expanding blood vessels in and around the anus, increasing the blood supply to the fissure and helping it heal faster. It can also help reduce the pressure in the anal canal, which should ease the pain. You'll usually have to use GTN ointment for at least six weeks, or until your fissure has completely healed. The majority of acute fissures (present for less than six weeks) will heal with GTN treatment. Around 7 in every 10 chronic fissures heal with GTN therapy if used correctly. Headaches are a very common side effect of GTN ointment, affecting up to half of people who use it. Some people also feel dizzy or lightheaded after using the ointment. GTN isn't suitable for children and should be used with caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women. If headaches are a problem, reducing the amount of ointment you use for a few days can help. Using a pea-sized amount of ointment five or six times a day is often better than using a larger amount twice a day. ","Advancement anal flaps":"Advancement anal flaps involve taking healthy tissue from another part of your body and using it to repair the fissure, thereby improving blood supply to the site of the fissure. This procedure may be recommended to treat long-term (chronic) anal fissures caused by pregnancy or an injury to the anal canal. Page last reviewed: 19/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","Painkillers":"If you experience prolonged burning pain after passing stools, your doctor may recommend taking common over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. If you decide to take these medications, make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the patient information leaflet or packet. ","Laxatives":"Laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you pass stools more easily. Adults with an anal fissure will usually be prescribed bulk-forming laxative tablets or granules. These work by helping your stools retain fluid, making them softer and less likely to dry out. Children with an anal fissure are usually prescribed an osmotic laxative oral solution. This type of laxative works by increasing the amount of fluid in the bowels, which stimulates the body to pass stools. Your GP may recommend starting treatment at a low dose and gradually increasing it every few days until you're able to pass soft stools every one or two days. ","Topical anaesthetics":"If you have particularly severe anal pain, your GP may prescribe a topical anaesthetic to numb your anus before passing stools. A topical medicine is one you apply directly to the affected area. It won't help fissures heal, but it can help ease the pain. Lidocaine is the most commonly prescribed topical anaesthetic for anal fissures. It comes in the form of either a gel or an ointment, and is usually only used for one to two weeks because the fissure should start to heal within this time. ","URL":"/conditions/Anal-fissure"},"Introduction":{" ":"An anal fissure is a tear or open sore (ulcer) that develops in the lining of the anal canal. The anal canal is the last part of the large intestine. It's located between the rectum \u2013 where stools are stored \u2013 and the opening in the bottom stools are passed through (anus). This page covers: Symptoms When to see your GP Diagnosis Causes Treatment and prevention The most common symptoms of anal fissures are: a sharp pain when you pass stools, often followed by a deep burning pain that may last several hours bleeding when you pass stools \u2013 most people notice a small amount of bright red blood either in their stools or on the toilet paper See your GP if you think you have an anal fissure. Don't let embarrassment stop you seeking help: anal fissures are a common problem GPs are used to dealing with. Most anal fissures get better without treatment, but your GP will want to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as piles (haemorrhoids). Your GP can also tell you about self-help measures and treatments that can relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of fissures recurring. Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and the type of pain you've been experiencing. They may also ask about your toilet habits. They'll usually be able to see the fissure by gently parting your buttocks. A digital rectal examination \u2013 where your GP inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your anus to feel for abnormalities \u2013 isn't usually used to diagnose anal fissures as it's likely to be painful. Your GP may refer you for specialist assessment if they think something serious may be causing your fissure. This may include a more thorough examination of your anus carried out using anaesthetic to minimise pain. Occasionally, a measurement of anal sphincter pressure may be taken for fissures that haven't responded to simple treatments. The anal sphincter is the ring of muscles that open and close the anus. Anal fissures are most commonly caused by damage to the lining of the anus or anal canal. Most cases occur in people who have constipation, when a particularly hard or large stool tears the lining of the anal canal. Other possible causes of anal fissures include: persistent diarrhoea inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis pregnancy and childbirth  occasionally, a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as syphilis or herpes, which can infect and damage the anal canal having unusually tight anal sphincter muscles, which can increase the tension in your anal canal, making it more susceptible to tearing In many cases, no clear cause can be identified. Anal fissures usually heal within a few weeks without the need for treatment. However, they can easily recur if they're caused by constipation that remains untreated. In some people, symptoms from anal fissures last six weeks or more (chronic anal fissures). Adopting some simple self-help measures can make passing stools easier. This will allow existing fissures to heal, as well as reduce your chances of developing new fissures in the future. Self-help measures for avoiding constipation include: plenty of fibre in your diet, such as fruit and vegetables and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice \u2013 adults should aim to eat at least 18g of fibre a day staying well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids not ignoring the urge to pass stools \u2013 this can cause your stools to dry out and become harder to pass exercising regularly \u2013 you should aim to do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week You can help soothe the pain by taking simple painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, or by soaking your bottom in a warm bath several times a day, particularly after a bowel movement. Your GP can also prescribe medication to help relieve your symptoms and speed up the healing process. This can include laxatives to help you pass stools more easily and painkilling ointment that you apply directly to your anus. Surgery may be recommended in persistent cases of anal fissure where self-help measures and medication haven't helped. Surgery is often very effective at treating anal fissures, but it does carry a small risk of complications, such as temporary or permanent loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence). Read more about treating anal fissures. Anal fissures are quite common, with around 1 in every 10 people affected at some point in their life. They affect both sexes equally and people of all ages can get them. However, children and young adults between 10 and 30 years of age are more likely to get anal fissures.

This topic may be helpful if you or a member of your family has recently had an amputation or is about to have one. It covers: Why an amputation may be needed Assessment before surgery How amputations are carried out Recovery Prosthetics Stump care Complications Psychological impact Help and support An amputation may be needed if: you have a severe infection in your limb your limb has been affected by gangrene (often as a result of peripheral arterial disease)  there's serious trauma to your limb, such as a crush or blast wound your limb is deformed and has limited movement and function Unless you need to have an emergency amputation, you'll be fully assessed before surgery to identify the most suitable type of amputation and any factors that may affect your rehabilitation. The assessment is likely to include: a thorough medical examination \u2013 assessing your physical condition, nutritional status, bowel and bladder function, your cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels) and your respiratory system (lungs and airways) an assessment of the condition and function of your healthy limb \u2013 removing one limb can place extra strain on the remaining limb, so it's important to look after the healthy limb  a psychological assessment \u2013 to determine how well you'll cope with the psychological and emotional impact of amputation, and whether you'll need additional support an assessment of your home, work and social environments \u2013 to determine whether any additional provisions will need to be made to help you cope You'll also be introduced to a physiotherapist, who will be involved in your post-operative care. A prosthetist (a specialist in prosthetic limbs) will advise you about the type and function of prosthetic limbs or other devices available. If you're having a planned amputation, you might find it reassuring to talk to someone who's had a similar type of amputation. A member of your care team may be able to put you in touch with someone. Amputations can be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) or using an epidural anaesthetic (which numbs the lower half of the body). Once the limb has been removed, a number of additional techniques can be used to help improve the function of the remaining limb and reduce the risk of complications. These include shortening and smoothing the bone in your remaining limb so it's covered by an adequate amount of soft tissue and muscle, and stitching the remaining muscle to the bones to help strengthen your remaining limb (a technique known as myodesis). After the amputation, your wound will be sealed with stitches or surgical staples. It will be covered with a bandage and a tube may be placed under your skin to drain away any excess fluid. The bandage will usually need to be kept in place for a few days to reduce the risk of infection. After surgery, you'll usually be given oxygen through a mask and fluids through a drip for the first few days while you recover on the ward. A small flexible tube (a urinary catheter) may be placed in your bladder during surgery to drain away urine. This means you won't need to worry about going to the toilet for the first few days after surgery. The site of the operation may be painful, so you'll be given painkillers if you need them. Tell a member of your care team if the painkillers aren't working, as you may need a larger dose or a stronger painkiller. A small tube may be used to deliver local anaesthetic to the nerves in your stump to help reduce pain. Your physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to help prevent blood clots and improve your blood supply while you're recovering in hospital. ","Going home and follow-up":"The length of time it will take before you're ready to go home will depend on the type of amputation you've had and your general state of health. Before you're discharged from hospital, an occupational therapist may arrange to visit you at home to see whether your home environment needs to be adapted to make it more accessible. For example, you may need a wheelchair ramp or a stairlift. If these types of modifications are required, the issue can be referred to your local social services department. Read about mobility, wheelchairs and scooters and assessing your care and support needs. It can take several months before you're fitted with a prosthetic limb (if you're a suitable for one), so you may be given a wheelchair to help you get around if you've had a lower limb amputation. You'll probably need to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after being discharged to discuss how well you're coping at home and whether you require additional help, support or equipment. At your appointment, you may also be given details of your nearest amputee support group, made up of both healthcare professionals and people living with an amputation. After an amputation, you may be able to have a prosthetic limb fitted. Prosthetic limbs aren't suitable for everyone who's had an amputation because an extensive course of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is required (see below). Adjusting to life with a prosthetic limb takes a considerable amount of energy because you have to compensate for the loss of muscle and bone in the amputated limb. This is why frail people or those with a serious health condition, such as heart disease, may not be suitable for a prosthetic limb. If you're able to have a prosthetic limb, the type of limb that's recommended for you will depend on: the type of amputation you had the amount of muscle strength in the remaining section of the limb your general state of health tasks the prosthetic limb will be expected to perform  whether you want the limb to look as real as possible or whether you're more concerned with function If it's thought that you would find it difficult to withstand the strain of using a prosthetic limb, a purely cosmetic limb may be recommended. This is a limb that looks like a real limb, but can't be used. It's possible to have a prosthetic limb that's both physically realistic and functional, but there may have to be an element of compromise between the two. ","Stump and \"phantom limb\" pain":"Many people who have an amputation experience some degree of stump pain or \"phantom limb\" pain. Phantom limb sensations are sensations that seem to be coming from the amputated limb. Occasionally, these can be painful (phantom limb pain). The term \"phantom\" doesn't mean the painful symptoms are imaginary. Phantom limb pain is a real phenomenon, which has been confirmed using brain imaging scans to study how nerve signals are transmitted to the brain. The symptoms of phantom limb pain can range from mild to severe. Some people have described brief \"flashes\" of mild pain, similar to an electric shock, that last for a few seconds. Others have described constant severe pain. Stump pain can have many different causes, including rubbing or sores where the stump touches a prosthetic limb, nerve damage during surgery and the development of neuromas. ","Preparing to have a prosthetic limb fitted":"If a prosthetic limb is suitable for you, you'll begin a programme of activities while still in hospital to prepare for the prosthetic. Before a prosthetic limb is fitted, the skin covering your stump may be made less sensitive (known as desensitisation). This will make the prosthetic more comfortable to wear. Skin desensitisation involves the following steps: gently tapping the skin with a face cloth using compression bandages to help reduce swelling and prevent a build-up of fluid inside and around your stump rubbing and pulling the skin around your bone to prevent excessive scarring Your physiotherapist will teach you a range of exercises to strengthen the muscles in your remaining limb and improve your general energy levels, so you're able to cope better with the demands of an artificial limb. Depending on what's available in your local area, it can be several months before you get your first appointment with a prosthetist (specialist in prosthetic limbs). It's very important to keep the skin on the surface of your stump clean to reduce the risk of it becoming irritated or infected. Gently wash your stump at least once a day (more frequently in hot weather) with mild unscented soap and warm water, and dry it carefully. If you have a prosthetic limb, you should also regularly clean the socket using soap and warm water. When taking a bath, avoid leaving your stump submerged in water for long periods because the water will soften the skin on your stump, making it more vulnerable to injury. If your skin becomes dry, use a moisturising cream before bedtime or when you're not wearing your prosthesis. Some people find wearing one or more socks around their stump helps absorb sweat and reduces skin irritation. The size of your stump may change as the swelling goes down, so the number of socks you need to use may vary. You should change the socks every day. Check your stump carefully every day for signs of infection, such as: warm, red and tender skin discharge of fluid or pus increasing swelling Contact your care team for advice if you think you may be developing a skin infection. ","Compression garments":"You'll notice swelling (oedema) of your stump after surgery. This is normal and it may continue after you've been discharged. Using a compression garment will help with swelling and the shape of the stump. It may also reduce phantom pain and help support the limb. You'll be fitted with a compression garment once your wound has healed. It should be worn every day, but taken off at bedtime. You should be given at least two garments, which should be washed regularly. ","Rehabilitation":"Physical rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process. It can be a long, difficult and frustrating process, but it's important to persevere. After rehabilitation, you should be able to return to work and other activities. Your rehabilitation programme will be tailored to your individual needs and requirements, and will aim to allow you to carry out as many of your normal activities as possible. You'll work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists who will discuss with you what you'd like to achieve from rehabilitation so that some realistic goals can be set. Your rehabilitation programme will usually start within a few days of surgery, beginning with some simple exercises you can do while lying down or sitting. If you've had a leg amputation, you'll be encouraged to move around as soon as possible using a wheelchair. You'll also be taught \"transfer techniques\" to help you move around more easily, such as how to get into a wheelchair from your bed. Once your wound has started to heal, you may start working on an exercise programme with a physiotherapist in the hospital gym to help you maintain your mobility and muscle strength. If you have a prosthetic limb fitted (see below), your physiotherapist will teach you how to use it \u2013 for example, how to walk on a prosthetic leg or grip with a prosthetic hand. ","Caring for your remaining limb":"After having a leg or foot amputated, it's very important to avoid injuring your remaining \"good\" leg and foot, particularly if your amputation was needed because of diabetes. Your remaining leg and foot may also be at risk. Avoid wearing poorly fitting footwear and ensure that an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a podiatrist, is involved in the care of your remaining foot. You should also be offered a regular review of your foot by the foot care team. Read more about diabetes and foot care. Like any type of surgery, an amputation carries a risk of complications. It also carries a risk of additional problems directly related to the loss of a limb. There are a number of factors that influence the risk of complications from amputation, such as your age, the type of amputation you've had, and your general health. The risk of serious complications is lower in planned amputations than in emergency amputations. Complications associated with having an amputation include: heart complications \u2013 such as heart attack deep vein thrombosis (DVT) slow wound healing and wound infection pneumonia stump and \"phantom limb\" pain In some cases, further surgery may be needed to correct problems that develop or to help relieve pain. For example, if neuromas (thickened nerve tissue) are thought to be causing pain, the affected cluster of nerves may need to be removed. ","URL":"/conditions/amputation","Treating stump and phantom limb pain":"Stump and phantom limb pain will usually improve over time, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Medications that may be used to help relieve pain include: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 such as ibuprofen anticonvulsants \u2013 such as carbamazepine or gabapentin antidepressants \u2013 such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline (these medications work directly on the nerves in your leg)  opioids \u2013 such as codeine or morphine corticosteroid or local anaesthetic injections There are several non-invasive techniques that may help relieve pain in some people. They include:  checking the fit of your prosthesis and making adjustments to make it feel more comfortable applying heat or cold to your limb, such as using heat or ice packs, rubs and creams massage \u2013 to increase circulation and stimulate muscles acupuncture \u2013 thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small, battery-operated device is used to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals mental imagery (see below) Research has shown that people who spend 40 minutes a day imagining using their phantom limb, such as stretching out their \"fingers\" or bunching up their \"toes\", experience a reduction in pain symptoms. This may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain (that the brain is looking to receive feedback from the amputated limb), and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitution for this missing feedback. Another technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve the pain from a phantom limb. The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact. Many people who've had an amputation report feeling emotions such as grief and bereavement, similar to experiencing the death of a loved one. Coming to terms with the psychological impact of an amputation is therefore often as important as coping with the physical demands. Having an amputation can have a considerable psychological impact for three main reasons: you have to cope with the loss of sensation from your amputated limb you have to cope with the loss of function from your amputated limb your sense of body image, and other people's perception of your body image, has changed Negative thoughts and emotions are common after an amputation. This is particularly true in people who've had an emergency amputation because they don't have time to mentally prepare for the effects of surgery. Common negative emotions and thoughts experienced by people after an amputation include: depression anxiety denial (refusing to accept that they need to make changes, such as having physiotherapy, to adapt to life with an amputation) grief feeling suicidal People who've had an amputation as a result of trauma (particularly members of the armed forces) also have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Talk to your care team about your thoughts and feelings, particularly if you're feeling depressed or suicidal. You may need additional treatment, such as antidepressants or counselling, to improve your ability to cope after having an amputation. Being told you need to have a limb amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience. Adjusting to life after an amputation can be challenging, but many people enjoy a good quality of life once they have managed to adapt. You may find it useful to contact a support group for people living with amputations. The Limbless Association can provide you with information and advice, as well as the details of various local support groups. Its phone number is 0800 644 0185 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). You may also find the Douglas Bader Foundation (DBF) a useful source of information and advice.

This topic may be helpful if you or a member of your family has recently had an amputation or is about to have one. It covers: Why an amputation may be needed Assessment before surgery How amputations are carried out Recovery Prosthetics Stump care Complications Psychological impact Help and support An amputation may be needed if: you have a severe infection in your limb your limb has been affected by gangrene (often as a result of peripheral arterial disease)  there's serious trauma to your limb, such as a crush or blast wound your limb is deformed and has limited movement and function Unless you need to have an emergency amputation, you'll be fully assessed before surgery to identify the most suitable type of amputation and any factors that may affect your rehabilitation. The assessment is likely to include: a thorough medical examination \u2013 assessing your physical condition, nutritional status, bowel and bladder function, your cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels) and your respiratory system (lungs and airways) an assessment of the condition and function of your healthy limb \u2013 removing one limb can place extra strain on the remaining limb, so it's important to look after the healthy limb  a psychological assessment \u2013 to determine how well you'll cope with the psychological and emotional impact of amputation, and whether you'll need additional support an assessment of your home, work and social environments \u2013 to determine whether any additional provisions will need to be made to help you cope You'll also be introduced to a physiotherapist, who will be involved in your post-operative care. A prosthetist (a specialist in prosthetic limbs) will advise you about the type and function of prosthetic limbs or other devices available. If you're having a planned amputation, you might find it reassuring to talk to someone who's had a similar type of amputation. A member of your care team may be able to put you in touch with someone. Amputations can be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) or using an epidural anaesthetic (which numbs the lower half of the body). Once the limb has been removed, a number of additional techniques can be used to help improve the function of the remaining limb and reduce the risk of complications. These include shortening and smoothing the bone in your remaining limb so it's covered by an adequate amount of soft tissue and muscle, and stitching the remaining muscle to the bones to help strengthen your remaining limb (a technique known as myodesis). After the amputation, your wound will be sealed with stitches or surgical staples. It will be covered with a bandage and a tube may be placed under your skin to drain away any excess fluid. The bandage will usually need to be kept in place for a few days to reduce the risk of infection. After surgery, you'll usually be given oxygen through a mask and fluids through a drip for the first few days while you recover on the ward. A small flexible tube (a urinary catheter) may be placed in your bladder during surgery to drain away urine. This means you won't need to worry about going to the toilet for the first few days after surgery. The site of the operation may be painful, so you'll be given painkillers if you need them. Tell a member of your care team if the painkillers aren't working, as you may need a larger dose or a stronger painkiller. A small tube may be used to deliver local anaesthetic to the nerves in your stump to help reduce pain. Your physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to help prevent blood clots and improve your blood supply while you're recovering in hospital. ","Going home and follow-up":"The length of time it will take before you're ready to go home will depend on the type of amputation you've had and your general state of health. Before you're discharged from hospital, an occupational therapist may arrange to visit you at home to see whether your home environment needs to be adapted to make it more accessible. For example, you may need a wheelchair ramp or a stairlift. If these types of modifications are required, the issue can be referred to your local social services department. Read about mobility, wheelchairs and scooters and assessing your care and support needs. It can take several months before you're fitted with a prosthetic limb (if you're a suitable for one), so you may be given a wheelchair to help you get around if you've had a lower limb amputation. You'll probably need to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after being discharged to discuss how well you're coping at home and whether you require additional help, support or equipment. At your appointment, you may also be given details of your nearest amputee support group, made up of both healthcare professionals and people living with an amputation. After an amputation, you may be able to have a prosthetic limb fitted. Prosthetic limbs aren't suitable for everyone who's had an amputation because an extensive course of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is required (see below). Adjusting to life with a prosthetic limb takes a considerable amount of energy because you have to compensate for the loss of muscle and bone in the amputated limb. This is why frail people or those with a serious health condition, such as heart disease, may not be suitable for a prosthetic limb. If you're able to have a prosthetic limb, the type of limb that's recommended for you will depend on: the type of amputation you had the amount of muscle strength in the remaining section of the limb your general state of health tasks the prosthetic limb will be expected to perform  whether you want the limb to look as real as possible or whether you're more concerned with function If it's thought that you would find it difficult to withstand the strain of using a prosthetic limb, a purely cosmetic limb may be recommended. This is a limb that looks like a real limb, but can't be used.

You'll work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists who will discuss with you what you'd like to achieve from rehabilitation so that some realistic goals can be set. Your rehabilitation programme will usually start within a few days of surgery, beginning with some simple exercises you can do while lying down or sitting. If you've had a leg amputation, you'll be encouraged to move around as soon as possible using a wheelchair. You'll also be taught \"transfer techniques\" to help you move around more easily, such as how to get into a wheelchair from your bed. Once your wound has started to heal, you may start working on an exercise programme with a physiotherapist in the hospital gym to help you maintain your mobility and muscle strength. If you have a prosthetic limb fitted (see below), your physiotherapist will teach you how to use it \u2013 for example, how to walk on a prosthetic leg or grip with a prosthetic hand. ","Caring for your remaining limb":"After having a leg or foot amputated, it's very important to avoid injuring your remaining \"good\" leg and foot, particularly if your amputation was needed because of diabetes. Your remaining leg and foot may also be at risk. Avoid wearing poorly fitting footwear and ensure that an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a podiatrist, is involved in the care of your remaining foot. You should also be offered a regular review of your foot by the foot care team. Read more about diabetes and foot care. Like any type of surgery, an amputation carries a risk of complications. It also carries a risk of additional problems directly related to the loss of a limb. There are a number of factors that influence the risk of complications from amputation, such as your age, the type of amputation you've had, and your general health. The risk of serious complications is lower in planned amputations than in emergency amputations. Complications associated with having an amputation include: heart complications \u2013 such as heart attack deep vein thrombosis (DVT) slow wound healing and wound infection pneumonia stump and \"phantom limb\" pain In some cases, further surgery may be needed to correct problems that develop or to help relieve pain. For example, if neuromas (thickened nerve tissue) are thought to be causing pain, the affected cluster of nerves may need to be removed. ","URL":"/conditions/amputation","Treating stump and phantom limb pain":"Stump and phantom limb pain will usually improve over time, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Medications that may be used to help relieve pain include: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 such as ibuprofen anticonvulsants \u2013 such as carbamazepine or gabapentin antidepressants \u2013 such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline (these medications work directly on the nerves in your leg)  opioids \u2013 such as codeine or morphine corticosteroid or local anaesthetic injections There are several non-invasive techniques that may help relieve pain in some people. They include:  checking the fit of your prosthesis and making adjustments to make it feel more comfortable applying heat or cold to your limb, such as using heat or ice packs, rubs and creams massage \u2013 to increase circulation and stimulate muscles acupuncture \u2013 thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small, battery-operated device is used to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals mental imagery (see below) Research has shown that people who spend 40 minutes a day imagining using their phantom limb, such as stretching out their \"fingers\" or bunching up their \"toes\", experience a reduction in pain symptoms. This may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain (that the brain is looking to receive feedback from the amputated limb), and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitution for this missing feedback. Another technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve the pain from a phantom limb. The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact. Many people who've had an amputation report feeling emotions such as grief and bereavement, similar to experiencing the death of a loved one. Coming to terms with the psychological impact of an amputation is therefore often as important as coping with the physical demands. Having an amputation can have a considerable psychological impact for three main reasons: you have to cope with the loss of sensation from your amputated limb you have to cope with the loss of function from your amputated limb your sense of body image, and other people's perception of your body image, has changed Negative thoughts and emotions are common after an amputation. This is particularly true in people who've had an emergency amputation because they don't have time to mentally prepare for the effects of surgery. Common negative emotions and thoughts experienced by people after an amputation include: depression anxiety denial (refusing to accept that they need to make changes, such as having physiotherapy, to adapt to life with an amputation) grief feeling suicidal People who've had an amputation as a result of trauma (particularly members of the armed forces) also have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Talk to your care team about your thoughts and feelings, particularly if you're feeling depressed or suicidal. You may need additional treatment, such as antidepressants or counselling, to improve your ability to cope after having an amputation. Being told you need to have a limb amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience. Adjusting to life after an amputation can be challenging, but many people enjoy a good quality of life once they have managed to adapt. You may find it useful to contact a support group for people living with amputations. The Limbless Association can provide you with information and advice, as well as the details of various local support groups. Its phone number is 0800 644 0185 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). You may also find the Douglas Bader Foundation (DBF) a useful source of information and advice.

This topic may be helpful if you or a member of your family has recently had an amputation or is about to have one. It covers: Why an amputation may be needed Assessment before surgery How amputations are carried out Recovery Prosthetics Stump care Complications Psychological impact Help and support An amputation may be needed if: you have a severe infection in your limb your limb has been affected by gangrene (often as a result of peripheral arterial disease)  there's serious trauma to your limb, such as a crush or blast wound your limb is deformed and has limited movement and function Unless you need to have an emergency amputation, you'll be fully assessed before surgery to identify the most suitable type of amputation and any factors that may affect your rehabilitation. The assessment is likely to include: a thorough medical examination \u2013 assessing your physical condition, nutritional status, bowel and bladder function, your cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels) and your respiratory system (lungs and airways) an assessment of the condition and function of your healthy limb \u2013 removing one limb can place extra strain on the remaining limb, so it's important to look after the healthy limb  a psychological assessment \u2013 to determine how well you'll cope with the psychological and emotional impact of amputation, and whether you'll need additional support an assessment of your home, work and social environments \u2013 to determine whether any additional provisions will need to be made to help you cope You'll also be introduced to a physiotherapist, who will be involved in your post-operative care. A prosthetist (a specialist in prosthetic limbs) will advise you about the type and function of prosthetic limbs or other devices available. If you're having a planned amputation, you might find it reassuring to talk to someone who's had a similar type of amputation. A member of your care team may be able to put you in touch with someone. Amputations can be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) or using an epidural anaesthetic (which numbs the lower half of the body). Once the limb has been removed, a number of additional techniques can be used to help improve the function of the remaining limb and reduce the risk of complications. These include shortening and smoothing the bone in your remaining limb so it's covered by an adequate amount of soft tissue and muscle, and stitching the remaining muscle to the bones to help strengthen your remaining limb (a technique known as myodesis). After the amputation, your wound will be sealed with stitches or surgical staples. It will be covered with a bandage and a tube may be placed under your skin to drain away any excess fluid. The bandage will usually need to be kept in place for a few days to reduce the risk of infection. After surgery, you'll usually be given oxygen through a mask and fluids through a drip for the first few days while you recover on the ward. A small flexible tube (a urinary catheter) may be placed in your bladder during surgery to drain away urine. This means you won't need to worry about going to the toilet for the first few days after surgery. The site of the operation may be painful, so you'll be given painkillers if you need them. Tell a member of your care team if the painkillers aren't working, as you may need a larger dose or a stronger painkiller. A small tube may be used to deliver local anaesthetic to the nerves in your stump to help reduce pain. Your physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to help prevent blood clots and improve your blood supply while you're recovering in hospital. ","Going home and follow-up":"The length of time it will take before you're ready to go home will depend on the type of amputation you've had and your general state of health. Before you're discharged from hospital, an occupational therapist may arrange to visit you at home to see whether your home environment needs to be adapted to make it more accessible. For example, you may need a wheelchair ramp or a stairlift. If these types of modifications are required, the issue can be referred to your local social services department. Read about mobility, wheelchairs and scooters and assessing your care and support needs. It can take several months before you're fitted with a prosthetic limb (if you're a suitable for one), so you may be given a wheelchair to help you get around if you've had a lower limb amputation. You'll probably need to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after being discharged to discuss how well you're coping at home and whether you require additional help, support or equipment. At your appointment, you may also be given details of your nearest amputee support group, made up of both healthcare professionals and people living with an amputation. After an amputation, you may be able to have a prosthetic limb fitted. Prosthetic limbs aren't suitable for everyone who's had an amputation because an extensive course of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is required (see below). Adjusting to life with a prosthetic limb takes a considerable amount of energy because you have to compensate for the loss of muscle and bone in the amputated limb. This is why frail people or those with a serious health condition, such as heart disease, may not be suitable for a prosthetic limb. If you're able to have a prosthetic limb, the type of limb that's recommended for you will depend on: the type of amputation you had the amount of muscle strength in the remaining section of the limb your general state of health tasks the prosthetic limb will be expected to perform  whether you want the limb to look as real as possible or whether you're more concerned with function If it's thought that you would find it difficult to withstand the strain of using a prosthetic limb, a purely cosmetic limb may be recommended. This is a limb that looks like a real limb, but can't be used. It's possible to have a prosthetic limb that's both physically realistic and functional, but there may have to be an element of compromise between the two. ","Stump and \"phantom limb\" pain":"Many people who have an amputation experience some degree of stump pain or \"phantom limb\" pain. Phantom limb sensations are sensations that seem to be coming from the amputated limb. Occasionally, these can be painful (phantom limb pain). The term \"phantom\" doesn't mean the painful symptoms are imaginary. Phantom limb pain is a real phenomenon, which has been confirmed using brain imaging scans to study how nerve signals are transmitted to the brain. The symptoms of phantom limb pain can range from mild to severe. Some people have described brief \"flashes\" of mild pain, similar to an electric shock, that last for a few seconds. Others have described constant severe pain. Stump pain can have many different causes, including rubbing or sores where the stump touches a prosthetic limb, nerve damage during surgery and the development of neuromas. ","Preparing to have a prosthetic limb fitted":"If a prosthetic limb is suitable for you, you'll begin a programme of activities while still in hospital to prepare for the prosthetic. Before a prosthetic limb is fitted, the skin covering your stump may be made less sensitive (known as desensitisation). This will make the prosthetic more comfortable to wear. Skin desensitisation involves the following steps: gently tapping the skin with a face cloth using compression bandages to help reduce swelling and prevent a build-up of fluid inside and around your stump rubbing and pulling the skin around your bone to prevent excessive scarring Your physiotherapist will teach you a range of exercises to strengthen the muscles in your remaining limb and improve your general energy levels, so you're able to cope better with the demands of an artificial limb. Depending on what's available in your local area, it can be several months before you get your first appointment with a prosthetist (specialist in prosthetic limbs). It's very important to keep the skin on the surface of your stump clean to reduce the risk of it becoming irritated or infected. Gently wash your stump at least once a day (more frequently in hot weather) with mild unscented soap and warm water, and dry it carefully. If you have a prosthetic limb, you should also regularly clean the socket using soap and warm water. When taking a bath, avoid leaving your stump submerged in water for long periods because the water will soften the skin on your stump, making it more vulnerable to injury. If your skin becomes dry, use a moisturising cream before bedtime or when you're not wearing your prosthesis. Some people find wearing one or more socks around their stump helps absorb sweat and reduces skin irritation. The size of your stump may change as the swelling goes down, so the number of socks you need to use may vary. You should change the socks every day. Check your stump carefully every day for signs of infection, such as: warm, red and tender skin discharge of fluid or pus increasing swelling Contact your care team for advice if you think you may be developing a skin infection. ","Compression garments":"You'll notice swelling (oedema) of your stump after surgery. This is normal and it may continue after you've been discharged. Using a compression garment will help with swelling and the shape of the stump. It may also reduce phantom pain and help support the limb. You'll be fitted with a compression garment once your wound has healed. It should be worn every day, but taken off at bedtime. You should be given at least two garments, which should be washed regularly. ","Rehabilitation":"Physical rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process. It can be a long, difficult and frustrating process, but it's important to persevere. After rehabilitation, you should be able to return to work and other activities. Your rehabilitation programme will be tailored to your individual needs and requirements, and will aim to allow you to carry out as many of your normal activities as possible. You'll work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists who will discuss with you what you'd like to achieve from rehabilitation so that some realistic goals can be set.

They include:  checking the fit of your prosthesis and making adjustments to make it feel more comfortable applying heat or cold to your limb, such as using heat or ice packs, rubs and creams massage \u2013 to increase circulation and stimulate muscles acupuncture \u2013 thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small, battery-operated device is used to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals mental imagery (see below) Research has shown that people who spend 40 minutes a day imagining using their phantom limb, such as stretching out their \"fingers\" or bunching up their \"toes\", experience a reduction in pain symptoms. This may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain (that the brain is looking to receive feedback from the amputated limb), and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitution for this missing feedback. Another technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve the pain from a phantom limb. The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact. Many people who've had an amputation report feeling emotions such as grief and bereavement, similar to experiencing the death of a loved one. Coming to terms with the psychological impact of an amputation is therefore often as important as coping with the physical demands. Having an amputation can have a considerable psychological impact for three main reasons: you have to cope with the loss of sensation from your amputated limb you have to cope with the loss of function from your amputated limb your sense of body image, and other people's perception of your body image, has changed Negative thoughts and emotions are common after an amputation. This is particularly true in people who've had an emergency amputation because they don't have time to mentally prepare for the effects of surgery. Common negative emotions and thoughts experienced by people after an amputation include: depression anxiety denial (refusing to accept that they need to make changes, such as having physiotherapy, to adapt to life with an amputation) grief feeling suicidal People who've had an amputation as a result of trauma (particularly members of the armed forces) also have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Talk to your care team about your thoughts and feelings, particularly if you're feeling depressed or suicidal. You may need additional treatment, such as antidepressants or counselling, to improve your ability to cope after having an amputation. Being told you need to have a limb amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience. Adjusting to life after an amputation can be challenging, but many people enjoy a good quality of life once they have managed to adapt. You may find it useful to contact a support group for people living with amputations. The Limbless Association can provide you with information and advice, as well as the details of various local support groups. Its phone number is 0800 644 0185 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). You may also find the Douglas Bader Foundation (DBF) a useful source of information and advice.

These are: macular translocation \u2013 where the macula is repositioned over a healthier section of the eyeball not affected by abnormal blood vessels lens implantation \u2013 where the lens of the eye is removed and replaced with an artificial lens designed to enhance central vision Both approaches tend to achieve better results than laser surgery, but there are also disadvantages, such as: limited access to these treatments \u2013 they may only be available in the context of a clinical trial uncertainty about whether these treatments are safe and effective in the long term they carry a higher risk of serious complications than laser surgery The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information about macular translocation (PDF, 97kb) and lens implantation (PDF, 100kb) on its website. ","Surgery":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed in the 1990s. It involves having a light-sensitive medicine called verteporfin injected into a vein in your arm. The verteporfin attaches itself to the abnormal blood vessels in your macula. A low-powered laser is then shone into your damaged eye over a circular area just larger than the affected area in your eye. This usually takes around one minute. The light from the laser is absorbed by the verteporfin and activates the drug. The activated verteporfin destroys the abnormal vessels in your macula while reducing harm to other delicate tissues in your eye. Destroying the blood vessels stops them leaking blood or fluid, preventing damage and therefore stopping the macular degeneration getting worse. You may need this treatment every few months to ensure any new blood vessels that start growing are kept under control. PDT isn't suitable for everyone \u2013 it will depend on where the blood vessels are growing and how severely they've affected your macula. It may be suitable if your visual acuity is 6/60 or better. This means you can see from a distance of six metres what someone with normal vision can see from a distance of 60 metres. Laser photocoagulation can also be used to treat some cases of wet AMD. This type of surgery is only suitable if the abnormal blood vessels aren't close to the fovea, as performing surgery close to this part of the eye can cause permanent vision loss. Around one in seven people may be suitable for treatment with laser photocoagulation. A powerful laser is used to burn sections of the retina. These sections harden, which prevents the blood vessels moving up into the macula. The surgery is carried out under local anaesthetic to numb the eye, so it isn't painful. One side effect of laser photocoagulation is a permanent black or grey patch developing in your field of vision. This loss of vision is usually \u2013 but not always \u2013 less severe than untreated wet AMD. If you're considering laser photocoagulation, you should discuss the pros and cons of the treatment with the doctor in charge of your care. The results tend to be less effective than the other treatments discussed above, so it only tends to be used in people who cannot be treated with anti-VEGF medication or PDT. ","Wet AMD":"The two main treatment options for wet AMD are: anti-VEGF medication \u2013 to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye laser surgery \u2013 to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye These treatments are described below. ","Treating macular degeneration ":"There's currently no cure for either type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), although vision aids and treatments may help. ","Dry AMD":"With dry AMD, the deterioration of vision can be very slow. You won't go completely blind, as your peripheral (side) vision shouldn't be affected. Help is available to make tasks such as reading and writing easier. Getting practical help may improve your quality of life and make it easier for you to carry out your daily activities. You may be referred to a low vision clinic. Staff at the clinic can provide useful advice and practical support to help minimise the effect dry AMD has on your life. For example, you may wish to try: magnifying lenses large-print books very bright reading lights screen-reading software on your computer so you can \"read\" emails and documents, and browse the internet Read more about changes to your home to make it easier to live with low vision. There's some evidence a diet high in vitamins A (beta-carotene), C and E \u2013 as well as substances called lutein and zeaxanthin \u2013 may slow the progression of dry AMD, and possibly even reduce your risk of getting wet AMD. Talk to an ophthalmologist about whether these could help you. Foods high in vitamins A, C and E include: oranges kiwis leafy green vegetables tomatoes carrots Leafy green vegetables are also a good source of lutein, as are peas, mangoes and sweetcorn. There's no definitive proof eating these foods will be effective for everyone with dry AMD, but this type of healthy diet has other important health benefits, too. Dietary supplements are also available, some of which claim to specifically improve eye health. However, these are rarely prescribed on the NHS so you'll usually have to buy them. It's important to check with your GP before taking supplements as they may not be suitable for everyone. Read more about vitamins and minerals. For more information, read a factsheet produced by the Macular Society about nutrition and eye health. ","Stem cell therapy":"Research is underway to try to create new retinal cells using stem cells (the body's \"master\" cells). Stem cells can potentially be grown into retinal cells in the lab, and can then be transplanted. A number of promising trials are currently being carried out across the world. See the Macular Society website for more information about stem cell therapy. Page last reviewed: 24/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 ","Radiotherapy":"Radiotherapy has been used to treat wet AMD in the past with varying results. Research was carried out recently to see whether using radiotherapy in combination with anti-VEGF injections may be of benefit in reducing the number of injections needed. The early results of some studies are encouraging, but the long-term benefits are still unknown. Radiotherapy may be available as part of a clinical trial. You'll need to be advised by your ophthalmologist as to whether you may be suitable for the treatment. ","Anti-VEGF medication":"VEGF stands for vascular endothelial growth factor. It's one of the chemicals responsible for the growth of new blood vessels in the eye caused by wet AMD. Anti-VEGF medicines block this chemical, stopping it producing blood vessels and preventing wet AMD getting worse. The medication is injected into your eye using a very fine needle. You'll be given local anaesthetic eye drops so the procedure doesn't hurt. Most people tolerate this very well, with minimal discomfort. In some cases, anti-VEGF medication can shrink the blood vessels in the eye and restore some of the sight lost as a result of macular degeneration. But your sight won't be restored completely, and not everyone will see an improvement. The anti-VEGF medications currently available on the NHS are ranibizumab and aflibercept, but these will only be prescribed if there's clear evidence using the medication will help improve or maintain your eyesight. Current recommendations are that ranibizumab and aflibercept should only be used if: your visual acuity (ability to detect fine detail) is between 6/12 and 6/96 there's no permanent damage to the fovea, the part of the eye that helps you see things in sharp detail the area affected by AMD is no larger than 12 times the size of the area inside the eye where the optic nerve connects to the retina there are signs the condition has been getting worse Your ophthalmologist should be able to tell you if you're suitable for treatment with ranibizumab or aflibercept. Studies show ranibizumab (brand name Lucentis) can help slow loss of visual acuity in more than 90% of people, and may even increase visual acuity in around a third of people. The injection into the eye will be given be a specialist doctor who's trained to administer these type of injections. To start with, you'll have a monthly injection of ranibizumab for three consecutive months. Your visual acuity will then be monitored during a maintenance phase. If your vision deteriorates during the maintenance phase, and it's thought to be caused by further fluid leakage, you may be given another injection of ranibizumab. Monitoring will continue and you'll have injections as necessary, with at least one month between injections. Treatment with ranibizumab will be stopped if your condition doesn't show signs of improvement or continues to get worse. Common side effects of ranibizumab include: minor bleeding in the eye feeling like there's something in the eye inflammation or irritation of the eye increased pressure within the eye Aflibercept (brand name Eylea) is a newer type of anti-VEGF medication for wet AMD. Studies have shown it's at least as effective as ranibizumab in treating people with the condition. As with ranibizumab, a specialist doctor who's experienced in giving this type of eye injection will administer aflibercept. To start with, you'll have a monthly injection of aflibercept for three consecutive months. There's no need for monitoring between injections. Depending on the outcome of treatment, you may have further injections once every two months. After 12 months, the intervals between injections may be extended depending on how well the medication is working. In this case, the doctor treating you will determine a monitoring schedule. Common side effects of aflibercept are similar to those of ranibizumab and may include minor bleeding, eye pain, eye irritation and increased eye pressure. ","URL":"/conditions/macular-degeneration"},"Introduction":{"Reducing your risk":"It's not always possible to prevent macular degeneration because it's not clear exactly what triggers the processes that cause the condition. Your risk of developing AMD is closely linked to your age and whether you have a family history of the condition. However, you may be able to reduce your risk of developing AMD, or help prevent it getting worse, by: stopping smoking if you smoke eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables moderating your consumption of alcohol \u2013 read more about alcohol units and recommendations trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight wearing UV-absorbing glasses when outside for long periods ","Introduction ":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a painless eye condition that causes you to lose central vision, usually in both eyes. Central vision is what you see when you focus straight ahead. In AMD, this vision becomes increasingly blurred, which means: reading becomes difficult  colours appear less vibrant people's faces are difficult to recognise This sight loss usually happens gradually over time, although it can sometimes be rapid. AMD doesn't affect your peripheral vision (side vision), which means it will not cause complete blindness.   Read more about the symptoms of age-related macular degeneration and the complications of age-related macular degeneration. ","When to seek medical advice":"Visit your GP or optometrist if your vision is getting gradually worse. If your vision suddenly gets worse, images are distorted or you notice blind spots in your field of vision, seek medical advice immediately and book an emergency appointment with an optometrist. If AMD is suspected, you'll be referred to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for tests and any necessary treatment. Read more about how age-related macular degeneration is diagnosed. ","Juvenile macular degeneration":"In rare cases, macular degeneration can affect younger people. This is sometimes known as juvenile macular degeneration. It can be present at birth or develop later, but it's almost always caused by an inherited genetic disorder, such as: Stargardt's disease \u2013 the most common cause of juvenile macular degeneration, this can start in childhood or early adulthood Best's disease \u2013 also known as Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy Sorsby's dystrophy \u2013 this often begins between the ages of 30 and 40  Page last reviewed: 24/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 ","Treating macular degeneration":"There's currently no cure for either type of AMD. With dry AMD, treatment aims to help a person make the most of their remaining vision \u2013 for example, magnifying lenses can be used to make reading easier. There's some evidence to suggest a diet rich in leafy green vegetables may slow the progression of dry AMD. Wet AMD can be treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medication. This aims to stop your vision getting worse by preventing further blood vessels developing. In some cases, laser surgery can also be used to destroy abnormal blood vessels. The early diagnosis and treatment of wet AMD is essential for reducing the risk of severe vision loss. Read more about treating age-related macular degeneration. ","Who's affected?":"AMD currently affects more than 600,000 people in the UK and is the leading cause of vision loss. By 2020, it's predicted almost 700,000 people will have late-stage AMD in the UK.  For reasons that are unclear, AMD tends to be more common in women than men. It's also more common in white and Chinese people. The condition is most common in people over the age of 50. It's estimated 1 in every 10 people over 65 have some degree of AMD. ","URL":"/conditions/macular-degeneration","Why it happens":"Macular degeneration develops when the part of the eye responsible for central vision (the macula) is unable to function as effectively as it used to. There are two main types \u2013 dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD develops when the cells of the macula become damaged by a build-up of deposits called drusen. It's the most common and least serious type of AMD, accounting for around 9 out of 10 cases. Vision loss is gradual, occurring over many years. However, an estimated 1 in 10 people with dry AMD go on to develop wet AMD. Wet AMD \u2013 sometimes called neovascular AMD \u2013 develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula and damage its cells. Wet AMD is more serious than dry AMD. Without treatment, vision can deteriorate within days. Read more about the causes of age-related macular degeneration. "},"Complications":{"Depression and anxiety":"Having to cope with losing part of your vision and coming to terms with the loss of some of your independence can be difficult, and it can affect your mental health. It's estimated around a third of people with AMD may have some form of depression or anxiety. If you're struggling with the changes to your life, you should speak to your GP or ophthalmologist (eye specialist). They'll be able to discuss treatment options with you, such as counselling, or they can refer you to a mental health professional for further assessment. ","Driving":"You'll need to inform the DVLA and your insurance company if you're diagnosed with AMD and you drive, as the condition may affect your ability to drive. If your eyesight is only slightly affected, it may still be safe for you to drive a vehicle. However, you'll probably need to have a series of sight tests to prove this. Central vision is very important for driving, and you won't be able to drive if you don't meet the standards set by the DVLA. The GOV.UK website has more information and advice about macular degeneration and driving. ","URL":"/conditions/macular-degeneration","Complications of macular degeneration ":"Being told you have age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can be frustrating and upsetting, as simple everyday tasks such as reading become more difficult. Speak to your GP if macular degeneration is having a significant effect on your daily life. They should be able to put you in touch with local support groups, who can provide guidance and practical help. Alternatively, you could call the Macular Society helpline on 0300 3030 111 (open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm) or the Royal National Institute of Blind People helpline on 0303 123 9999 (open Monday to Friday, 8.45am to 5.30pm). Read more about help and support for blindness and vision loss. ","Visual hallucinations":"Some people with macular degeneration experience visual hallucinations caused by their low vision. This is known as Charles Bonnet syndrome. It's estimated about 1 in 10 people with AMD experiences Charles Bonnet syndrome. As AMD can prevent you from receiving the visual stimulation you're used to, your brain can sometimes compensate by creating fantasy images or using images stored in your memory. These are known as hallucinations. The hallucinations you experience may include unusual patterns or shapes, animals, faces, or an entire scene. They can be either black and white or colour, and may last from a few minutes to several hours. They're usually pleasant images, although they may be unsettling and scary to experience. Many people with Charles Bonnet syndrome don't tell their GP about their symptoms because they worry it may be a sign of a mental condition. However, the hallucinations experienced with this syndrome are usually the result of a problem with your vision and not a reflection of your mental state. Speak to your GP if you experience any kind of visual hallucination. There are ways they can help you learn how to cope. The hallucinations will usually last for around 18 months, although they may last years for some people.  Page last reviewed: 24/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 "},"Causes":{"Wet AMD":"In cases of wet AMD, tiny new blood vessels begin to grow underneath the macula. It's thought these blood vessels form as an attempt by the body to clear away the drusen from the retina. Unfortunately, the blood vessels form in the wrong place and cause more harm than good. They can leak blood and fluid into the eye, which can cause scarring and damage to your macula. The damage and scarring causes the more serious symptoms of wet AMD to develop, such as distorted vision and blind spots. ","Causes of macular degeneration ":"The exact cause of macular degeneration isn't known, but the condition develops as the eye ages. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by a problem with part of the eye called the macula. The macula is the spot at the centre of your retina (the nerve tissue that lines the back of your eye). The macula is where incoming rays of light are focused. It helps you see things directly in front of you and is used for close, detailed activities, such as reading and writing.  ","Increased risk":"It's unclear what triggers the processes that lead to AMD, but a number of things increase your risk of developing it. These are described below. The older a person gets, the more likely they are to develop at least some degree of AMD. Most cases start developing in people aged 50 or over and rise sharply with age. It's estimated 1 in every 10 people over 65 has some signs of AMD. AMD has been known to run in families. If your parents, brothers or sisters develop AMD, it's thought your risk of also developing the condition is increased. This suggests certain genes you inherit from your parents may increase your risk of getting AMD. However, it's not clear which genes are involved and how they're passed through families. A person who smokes is up to four times more likely to develop AMD than someone who's never smoked. The longer you've been smoking, the greater your risk of getting AMD. You're at even greater risk if you smoke and have a family history of AMD. Read more about how to stop smoking. Studies have found rates of AMD are highest in white and Chinese people, and lower in black people. This could be the result of genetics. ","Dry AMD":"As you get older, the light-sensitive cells in the macula can start to break down. This tends to occur gradually, often over many years. Waste products can also begin to build up in your retina, forming small deposits called drusen. Drusen are a common feature of dry AMD and tend to increase in size as the condition progresses. As dry AMD progresses, you'll have fewer light-sensitive cells in your macula, causing your central vision to deteriorate. A blurred spot will develop in the centre of your vision, making your central vision less well-defined. As a result, you may need more light when reading and carrying out other close work. ","Other possible risk factors":"The following things may increase your risk of developing AMD, although this hasn't yet been proven. It's possible drinking more than four units of alcohol a day over many years may increase your risk of developing early AMD. If you're exposed to lots of sunlight during your lifetime, your risk of developing macular degeneration may be increased. To protect yourself, you should wear UV-absorbing sunglasses if you spend long periods of time outside in bright sunlight. Some studies have reported being obese \u2013 having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater \u2013 may increase your chance of developing AMD. There's some limited evidence that having a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) or coronary heart disease may increase your risk of developing AMD. Page last reviewed: 24/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/macular-degeneration"},"Title":"Macular degeneration","Diagnosis":{"Amsler grid":"One of the first tests involves asking you to look at a special grid, known as an Amsler grid. The grid is made up of vertical and horizontal lines, with a dot in the middle. If you have macular degeneration, it's likely some of the lines will appear faded, broken or distorted. Saying which lines are distorted or broken will give your ophthalmologist a better idea of the extent of the damage to your macula. As the macula controls your central field of vision, it's usually the lines nearest to the centre of the grid that appear distorted. Eyecare Trust has a version of the Amsler grid (PDF, 51.2kb) on its website that you can print off and use at home to check for possible signs of AMD. ","Diagnosing macular degeneration ":"In some cases, early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) may be detected during a routine eye test before it starts to cause symptoms. If you're experiencing symptoms of macular degeneration, such as blurred central vision, visit your GP or make an appointment with an optometrist, a healthcare professional trained to recognise signs of eye problems. Find your nearest optician. ","Referral":"If your GP or optometrist suspects macular degeneration, you'll be referred to an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in diagnosing and treating eye conditions. Your appointment will usually be at a hospital eye department. If you need to travel by car to the hospital, ask someone else to drive you back as the eye drops given to you may make your vision blurry. ","Eye examination":"The ophthalmologist will examine your eyes. You'll be given eye drops to enlarge your pupils. These take around half an hour to start working, and may make your vision blurry or your eyes sensitive to light. The effect of the eye drops will wear off after a few hours. The ophthalmologist will use a magnifying device with a light attached to look at the back of your eyes, where your retina and macula are. They'll check for any abnormalities around your retina. The ophthalmologist will then carry out a series of tests to confirm a diagnosis of macular degeneration. ","Visual acuity":"You may hear your GP or eye specialist referring to your \"visual acuity\". This is a measure of your ability to see fine detail and is often used as a way to describe how good your vision is. Visual acuity is made up of two figures. For example, if your visual is 6/60, it means you can see from six metres or less what someone with normal vision can see from 60 metres away. Read more about blindness and vision loss. Page last reviewed: 24/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 ","Staging of AMD":"Once these tests have been completed, your ophthalmologist should be able to tell you how far your AMD has progressed. Dry AMD has three main stages, described below. early \u2013 at this stage there may be many small collections of drusen (deposits) inside the eye, a few medium-sized drusen, or some minor damage to your retina; early AMD may not cause any noticeable symptoms intermediate \u2013 there may be some larger drusen inside the eye or some tissue damage to the outer section of the macula; you'll have a blurred spot in the centre of your vision advanced \u2013 the centre of the macula is damaged; you'll have a large blurred central spot and find it difficult to read and recognise faces Wet AMD is always considered to be an advanced form of AMD. ","URL":"/conditions/macular-degeneration","Retinal imaging":"As part of your diagnosis, your ophthalmologist will need to photograph your retinas to see what damage, if any, macular degeneration has caused. As well as confirming the diagnosis, the images will prove useful in planning your treatment. There are several different ways of taking pictures of the retina. A fundus camera is a special camera used to take photographs of the inside of your eye. It can capture three-dimensional images of your macula. Your ophthalmologist can then look at the different layers of your retina to see what damage, if any, has occurred.  Angiography is an examination that creates detailed images of your blood vessels and the bloodflow inside them. A special dye is injected into your blood vessels and pictures are taken that show any abnormalities inside them. The procedure can confirm which type of AMD you have. It may be carried out if your ophthalmologist suspects wet AMD. Your ophthalmologist will inject a special dye called fluorescein into a vein in your arm. The dye will move through your blood vessels into your retina. They will look into your eyes using a magnifying device and take a series of pictures using a special camera. These images will allow your ophthalmologist to see whether any of the dye is leaking from the blood vessels behind your macula. If it is, this may confirm you have wet AMD. The technique used for indocyanine green (ICG) angiography is the same as for fluorescein angiography, but the dye is different. ICG dye can highlight slightly different problems in your eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses special rays of light to scan your retina and produce an image of it. This can provide detailed information about your macula. For example, it will tell your ophthalmologist whether your macula is thickened or abnormal, and whether any fluid has leaked into the retina. "},"Symptoms":{"Wet AMD":"In most cases, wet AMD develops in people who've already had dry AMD. If you have wet AMD, any blurring in your central vision will suddenly worsen. You may also experience other symptoms, such as: visual distortions \u2013 for example, straight lines may appear wavy or crooked blind spots \u2013 these usually appear in the middle of your visual field and become larger the longer they're left untreated hallucinations \u2013 seeing shapes, people or animals that aren't really there See complications of AMD for more information.

Complications that can occur during or after an angioplasty include: bleeding or bruising under the skin where the catheter was inserted \u2013 estimated to occur in more than one in every 20 cases damage to the artery where the sheath was inserted \u2013 estimated to occur in less than one in every 100 cases allergic reaction to the contrast agent used during the procedure \u2013 estimated to occur in less than one in every 100 cases damage to an artery in the heart \u2013 estimated to occur in less than one in every 350 cases excessive bleeding requiring a blood transfusion \u2013 estimated to occur in less than one in every 100 cases heart attack, stroke or death \u2013 estimated to occur in less than one in every 100 cases ","URL":"/conditions/Coronary-angioplasty"},"Introduction":{"When a coronary angioplasty is used":"Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries. In older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease. If the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. While angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective. Coronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack. ","Introduction ":"A coronary angioplasty is a procedure used to widen blocked or narrowed coronary arteries (the main blood vessels supplying the heart). The term 'angioplasty' means using a balloon to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery. However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely. Coronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ","What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty?":"In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they\u2019re able to do more than they could before the procedure. If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future. ","Are there any alternatives?":"If many coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed, or the structure of your arteries is abnormal, a coronary artery bypass graft may be considered. This is a type of invasive surgery where sections of healthy blood vessel are taken from other parts of the body and attached to the coronary arteries. Blood is diverted through these vessels, so it bypasses the narrowed or clogged parts of the arteries. Read more about the alternatives to a coronary angioplasty. Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","How a coronary angioplasty is performed":"A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out. A thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video. When the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed. If a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed. A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week. If you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home. Read more about:  what happens during a coronary angioplasty  recovering from a coronary angioplasty ","How safe is a coronary angioplasty?":"A coronary angioplasty is one of the most common types of treatment for the heart. Around 75,000 procedures are performed in England each year. Coronary angioplasties are most commonly performed in people aged 65 or older, as they're more likely to have heart disease. As the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people. Doctors refer to this as a minimally invasive form of treatment. The risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is generally small, but this depends on factors such as: your age your general health whether you've had a heart attack Serious problems that can occur as a result of the procedure include excessive bleeding, a heart attack and a stroke. Read more about the possible complications of a coronary angioplasty. ","URL":"/conditions/Coronary-angioplasty"},"Title":"Coronary angioplasty and stent insertion","Recovery":{"Activities":"Your hospital team can usually advise you about how long it will take to recover and if there are any activities you need to avoid in the meantime. In most cases, you'll be advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for about a week, or until the wound has healed. You shouldn't drive a car for a week after having a coronary angioplasty. If you drive a heavy vehicle for a living, such as a lorry or a bus, you must inform the DVLA that you've had a coronary angioplasty. They'll arrange further testing before you can return to work. You should be able to drive again as long as you meet the requirements of an exercise/function test and you don't have another disqualifying health condition. GOV.UK has more information on coronary angioplasty and driving. If you had a planned (non-emergency) coronary angioplasty, you should be able to return to work after a week. However, if you've had an emergency angioplasty following a heart attack, it may be several weeks or months before you recover fully and are able to return to work. If your sex life was previously affected by angina, you may be able to have a more active sex life as soon as you feel ready after a coronary angioplasty. If you have any concerns, speak to your GP. According to experts, having sex is the equivalent of climbing a couple of flights of stairs in terms of the strain it puts on your heart. ","Medication and further treatment":"Most people need to take blood-thinning medications for up to one year after having an angioplasty. This is usually a combination of low-dose aspirin and one of the following medications:  clopidogrel prasugrel ticagrelor It's very important you follow your medication schedule. If you stop your medication early, it greatly increases your risk of a heart attack caused by the treated artery becoming blocked. The course of clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor will usually be withdrawn after about a year, but most people need to continue taking low-dose aspirin for the rest of their life. You may need to have another angioplasty if your artery becomes blocked again and your angina symptoms return. Alternatively, you may need a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). ","Recovering from an angioplasty ":"After having a planned (non-emergency) coronary angioplasty, you'll normally be able to leave hospital the same day or following day. Arrange for someone to take you home. Before you leave hospital, you should be given advice on: any medication you need to take (see below) improving your diet and lifestyle wound care and hygiene advice during your recovery You may also be given a date for a follow-up appointment to check on your progress. You may have a bruise under the skin where the catheter was inserted. This isn't serious, but it may be sore for a few days. Occasionally, the wound can become infected. Keep an eye on it to check it's healing properly. Your chest may also feel tender after the procedure, but this is normal and usually passes in a few days. If necessary, you can take paracetamol to relieve any pain. ","Lifestyle changes":"If you have a coronary angioplasty, it's still important to take steps to reduce your risk of having further problems in the future. This may include: trying to lose weight if you're overweight stopping smoking if you smoke eating a healthy diet with low levels of fat and salt being active and exercising regularly Smoking and being overweight are two of the main causes of heart disease. They also make treatment less likely to work. See healthy hearts for more lifestyle advice. ","When to seek medical advice":"You should contact the hospital unit where the procedure was carried out, your specialist cardiac nurse, or your GP for advice if you develop: a hard, tender lump (larger than the size of a pea) under the skin around your wound increasing pain, swelling and redness around your wound a high temperature (fever) Dial 999 for an ambulance if you experience: any bleeding from your wound that doesn't stop or restarts after applying pressure for 10 minutes severe, constant pain discolouration, coldness or numbness in the leg or arm where the incision was made Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Cardiac rehabilitation":"Cardiac rehabilitation should be offered if you've had a heart operation. This programme aims to help you recover from the procedure and get back to everyday life as quickly as possible. Your cardiac rehabilitation programme will begin when you're in hospital. You should also be invited back for another session taking place within 10 days of leaving hospital. A member of the cardiac rehabilitation team will visit you in hospital and provide detailed information about: your state of health the type of treatment you received what medications you'll need when you leave hospital what specific risk factors are thought to have contributed to needing the operation what lifestyle changes you can make to address those risk factors Once you've completed your rehabilitation programme, it's important you continue to take regular exercise and lead a healthy lifestyle (see below). This helps protect your heart and reduce the risk of further heart-related problems. The British Heart Foundation has more information about cardiac rehabilitation. ","URL":"/conditions/Coronary-angioplasty"},"Alternatives":{"Alternative types of coronary angioplasty":"If a conventional coronary angioplasty is unsuitable because the deposits in your coronary arteries are very hard, you may be offered a different type of angioplasty procedure that involves destroying or cutting away these deposits. Examples of this type of procedure include: percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy (PTCRA) \u2013 where a small rotating device is used to remove the fatty deposit percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty \u2013 where a laser is used to burn through the fatty deposit These procedures are usually used when the coronary artery has a high level of calcium in it. Calcium makes the artery very hard and can prevent balloons or stents expanding properly to relieve the narrowing. Once the deposit has been removed, the artery is treated with balloons and stents as during a conventional angioplasty procedure. Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Coronary artery bypass graft":"A coronary artery bypass graft is surgery to bypass a blockage in an artery. This is done using segments of healthy blood vessel, called grafts, taken from other parts of the body. Segments of vein or artery from your legs, arms or chest are used to create a new channel through which blood can be directed past the blocked part of the artery. This allows more blood to get through into the heart muscle. Complications of CABG are uncommon, but are potentially serious. They include: a heart attack \u2013 estimated to occur in one in every 15-50 cases a stroke \u2013 estimated to occur in one in every 50 cases A CABG is usually recommended when multiple coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed. However, it's invasive surgery so may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail and in poor health. A CABG may also be used if the anatomy of the blood vessels near your heart is abnormal because a coronary angioplasty may not be possible in these cases. You may not always be able to choose between having a coronary angioplasty or a CABG, but if you are it's important to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. As a coronary angioplasty is minimally invasive, you'll recover from the effects of the operation quicker than you will from a CABG. Coronary angioplasty usually has a smaller risk of complications, but there's a chance you'll need further treatment because the affected artery may narrow again. However, the number of people who need further surgery has fallen because of the use of drug-eluting stents. See how a coronary angioplasty is performed for more information about these. CABG has a longer recovery time than coronary angioplasty and a higher risk of complications. However, only one person in 10 who has a CABG requires further treatment. Also, some evidence suggests that CABG is usually a more effective treatment option for people who are over 65 years of age and particularly for people with diabetes. You should discuss the benefits and risks of both types of treatment with your cardiologist and cardiac surgeon before making a decision. ","Alternatives to angioplasty and a stent ":"The most widely used surgical alternative to a coronary angioplasty is a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). ","URL":"/conditions/Coronary-angioplasty"},"How it's performed":{"The operation":"A coronary angioplasty usually takes place in a room called a catheterisation laboratory, rather than in an operating theatre. This is a room fitted with X-ray equipment to allow the doctor to monitor the procedure on a screen. A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours, although it can take longer. You'll be asked to lie on your back on an X-ray table. You'll be linked up to a heart monitor and given a local anaesthetic to numb your skin. An intravenous (IV) line will also be inserted into a vein, in case you need to have painkillers or a sedative. The cardiologist then makes a small incision in the skin of your groin, wrist or arm, over an artery where your pulse can be felt. A small tube called a sheath is inserted into the artery to keep it open during the procedure. A catheter is passed through the sheath and guided along the artery into the opening of your left or right coronary artery. A thin, flexible wire is then passed down the inside of the catheter to beyond the narrowed area. A small, sausage-shaped balloon is passed over the wire to the narrowed area and inflated for about 20-30 seconds. This squashes the fatty material on the inside walls of the artery to widen it. This may be done several times. While the balloon is inflated, the artery will be completely blocked and you may have some chest pain. However, this is normal and is nothing to worry about. The pain should go away when the balloon is deflated. Ask your cardiologist for pain medication if you find it uncomfortable. You shouldn't feel anything else as the catheter moves through the artery, but you may feel an occasional missed or extra heartbeat. This is nothing to worry about and is completely normal. If you're having a stent inserted (see below), it will be already fitted onto a balloon and opens up as the balloon is inflated. The stent will be left inside your artery after the balloon is deflated and removed. When the operation is finished, the cardiologist will check that your artery is wide enough to allow blood to flow through more easily. This is done by monitoring a small amount of contrast dye as it flows through the artery. The balloon, wire, catheter and sheath are then removed and any bleeding is stopped with a dissolvable plug or firm pressure. In some cases, the sheath is left in place for a few hours or overnight before being removed. ","Deciding where to get treatment":"Look for a cardiac centre that does at least 400 angioplasties each year. Choose a cardiologist (heart specialist) who does more than 75 angioplasties a year. These specialists are known as \"interventional cardiologists\". Page last reviewed: 09/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","How a coronary angioplasty is carried out ":"Before having a coronary angioplasty you'll need an assessment to make sure the operation is possible. This also gives you an opportunity to discuss any concerns with your cardiologist (heart specialist). A procedure called cardiac catheterisation and coronary angiography is used to examine the arteries near your heart to make sure the operation is possible. A long, flexible plastic tube called a catheter (about the width of the lead in a pencil) is inserted into a blood vessel, either in your groin or arm.  The tip of the catheter is guided to your heart, or the arteries supplying your heart, using an X-ray. A special fluid that shows up on X-rays, known as contrast medium, is injected through the catheter. The resulting pictures are called angiograms. During your pre-operative assessment, you may also have blood tests and a general health check to ensure you're suitable for surgery. You'll be asked not to eat or drink anything for four to six hours before a coronary angioplasty. You'll usually be able to take most medications as normal up to the day of the procedure, with the exception of blood-thinning medication (anticoagulants), such as: warfarin dabigatran rivaroxaban apixaban edoxaban You may also need to alter the timing of any diabetes medication you take. Your medical team can give you more information about this. Read more about preparing for an operation. ","Stents":"A stent is a short, wire-mesh tube that acts like a scaffold to help keep your artery open. There are two main types of stent: bare metal (uncoated) stent drug-eluting stent \u2013 which is coated with medication that reduces the risk of the artery becoming blocked again The biggest drawback of using bare metal stents is that, in around a third of cases, the arteries begin to narrow again. This is because the immune system sees the stent as a foreign body and attacks it, causing swelling and excessive tissue growth around the stent. It's possible to avoid this problem by using drug-eluting stents. These are coated with medication that reduces the body\u2019s abnormal response and tissue growth. However, this also delays the healing of the coronary artery around the stent and means it's vitally important to keep taking blood thinning treatment (see below) for up to one year after the procedure. This helps reduce the risk of a blood clot blocking the stent suddenly and causing a heart attack. Once a drug-eluting stent is in place, the medication is released over time into the area most likely to become blocked again. The two most researched types of medication are: \"-limus\" medications (such as sirolimus, everolimus and zotarolimus) \u2013 which have previously been used to prevent rejection in organ transplants paclitaxel \u2013 which inhibits cell growth and is commonly used in chemotherapy The use of drug-eluting stents has reduced the rate of arteries re-narrowing from around one third to less than one in 10 and they are now used in more than 70% of stent procedures. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that drug-eluting stents should be considered if the artery being treated is less than 3mm in diameter or the affected section of the artery is longer than 15mm, because evidence suggests the risk of re-narrowing is highest in these cases. Before your procedure, discuss the benefits and risks of each type of stent with your cardiologist. If you have a stent, you'll also need to take certain medications to help reduce the risk of blood clots forming around the stent. These include: aspirin, taken every morning for life clopidogrel, taken for one to 12 months depending on whether you have had a bare metal or drug-eluting stent, or whether you have had a heart attack prasugrel or ticagrelor, which are used as alternatives to clopidogrel in people who have been treated for a heart attack ","URL":"/conditions/Coronary-angioplasty","Going home":"A coronary angioplasty often involves an overnight stay in hospital, but many people can go home on the same day if the procedure is straightforward. After the operation, you won't be able to drive for one week, so you'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home from hospital. Read more about recovering from a coronary angioplasty. "}},"Arm, broken":{"Introduction":{" ":"A broken (fractured) arm or wrist needs to be treated as soon as possible. It typically takes a month or two to heal. This page covers: Symptoms What to do Treatment Recovery Signs of a broken arm or wrist include: severe pain and tenderness bruising and swelling difficulty moving the hand or arm the wrist or arm being an odd shape a snap or grinding noise at the time of injury bleeding (if the bone has damaged the skin) \u2013 sometimes the bone may poke through the skin tingling and numbness Because of the shock and pain of breaking your arm, you may also feel faint, dizzy or sick. It can be hard to tell the difference between a minor break and a sprain. It's best to assume it's a fracture until it has been checked by a doctor or nurse. If you think you or someone else has a broken arm or wrist: go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance if it's a bad break \u2013 minor fractures can often be treated at a local minor injuries unit avoid moving the affected arm as much as possible \u2013 it may help to support it in a sling that goes under the arm and around the neck; find out how to make an arm sling stop any bleeding by applying pressure to the wound with a clean pad or dressing if possible apply an ice pack (such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to the injured area if one is easily available don't eat or drink anything in case you need surgery to fix the bone when you get to hospital If your child has injured their arm or wrist, try to get someone else to drive so you can support and comfort them. When you arrive at the hospital, you'll be given painkillers and a support (splint) may be fixed to your arm to secure it in position. An X-ray will be carried out to check whether your arm or wrist is broken and how severe the break is. For a minor fracture: a plaster cast or removable splint will usually be applied \u2013 sometimes this may be done a few days later, to allow any swelling to go down first (a splint can be left on until a cast is fitted) you may be given a sling to support your arm you'll be given painkillers to take home and told how to look after your cast you'll probably be asked to attend follow-up appointments to check how your arm or wrist is healing For more serious fractures: a doctor may try to realign the broken bones with their hands \u2013 this will usually be done while you're awake, but your arm will be numbed and you may be given medicine to relax you  surgery may be carried out to realign the bones \u2013 this will often involve putting wires, plates, screws or rods inside your arm, but sometimes a temporary external frame may be used a plaster cast will usually be applied to your arm before you go home you'll be asked to attend follow-up appointments to check how your arm or wrist is healing Your cast will need to stay on until the broken bone has healed. This usually takes a month or two, but can take longer if the break was severe. While your arm is in a cast: avoid putting weight or strain on the arm \u2013 don't stop moving it completely, but avoid activities such as carrying anything heavy, driving and sports keep the cast dry and keep your arm raised (for example, on pillows) whenever possible \u2013 read more about how to care for a plaster cast do some gentle exercises and stretches to reduce stiffness \u2013 your doctor or a physiotherapist will advise you about this; see an NHS leaflet on getting your hand moving after a wrist fracture (PDF, 170kb) for examples of exercises to try get medical advice if you notice changes in your skin colour, unusual sensations in your arm or wrist, signs of infection (redness, swelling or smelly discharge), severe or continuous pain, or problems with your cast (it's too loose, too tight or cracked) Speak to your doctor about when you can return to work and normal activities. They will probably suggest gradually increasing how much you use your arm and hand over a few weeks or months. Your arm or wrist may be stiff and weak after the cast is removed. A physiotherapist can help with these problems, although sometimes they can last several months or more.

If you have a DSD, you'll have a mix of male and female sexual characteristics. You may have sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) normally associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or male (XY chromosomes), but your reproductive organs and genitals may be: of the opposite sex not clearly male or female (ambiguous or atypical) a mixture of male and female This occurs because of a difference with your genes and/or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body. It can be inherited, but it often occurs randomly for no clear reason. The most common times to find out that a child has a DSD is at birth or during adolescence. This page covers: Types of DSDs What happens after birth Advice for parents of older children If you think you have a DSD Support groups There are many different types of DSD. Below are some examples. ","Normal genitals but abnormal sexual development":"Some people have neither XY nor XX chromosomes \u2013 for example, they may only have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY). Their sex organs are normally either male or female, but they may not go through normal sexual development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods. Doctors refer to this condition as sex chromosome DSD. One type is Klinefelter syndrome, which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). This can mean they don't produce enough testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics and important for maintaining bone strength, sex drive and fertility in men. Another type is Turner syndrome, which is where a girl is missing an X chromosome. Girls and women with Turner syndrome are usually infertile and their height is shorter than average. ","Male genes with female genitals but some internal male structures":"Some people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may appear entirely female or atypical. The womb may be present or absent and the testicles may remain in the body or not form properly. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. There are several different causes of this condition. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body ignores androgens or is insensitive to them, so external development is female. For support and more information on AIS, you can visit the AIS Support Group.  ","Female with normal genitals but an absent womb":"Some females are born with an underdeveloped or absent womb, cervix and upper vagina, but the ovaries and external genitalia are still present and they still develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older. This is known as Rokitansky syndrome (also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser or MRKH syndrome). The cause isn't clear, but it's not related to chromosomes because girls and women with it have the normal XX chromosomes. Often the first sign is that a girl doesn't start having periods. Sex may also be difficult because the vagina is shorter than normal. As they have no womb, women with Rokitansky syndrome cannot become pregnant, but it's sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman (surrogate). For support and more information on Rokitansky syndrome, you can visit the websites of MRKH UK, Living MRKH and the MRKH Organization. ","A mix of male and female characteristics":"People with this very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue \u2013 for example, one ovary and one testis \u2013 and their genitals may appear female, male or a mix of both. Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes. The cause isn't usually clear, but some cases have been linked to genetic material normally found on the Y chromosome being found on the X chromosome. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD. Some DSDs are suspected soon after birth because of obvious signs such as undescended testicles or an atypical genital appearance. A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm the diagnosis and identify any medical problems that may require immediate treatment. These tests may include a further physical examination of your baby carried out by a specialist, an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs, and blood tests to check their genes and hormone levels. Your care team may advise you to delay registering your child's birth for a few days while these tests are carried out. Afterwards, the results will be explained to you and you'll have a discussion about whether you'd like to bring your baby up as a boy or a girl. Emergency treatment is rarely needed, but the team of specialists will also talk to you about your options regarding immediate or delayed treatment with hormone therapy or surgery. DSD Families has a leaflet with more information about what happens when your baby is born with genitals that look different (PDF, 1.7Mb). Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child doesn't develop normally in puberty. For example, your child may not start the normal puberty changes, or may start puberty but not get periods. Speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your child's development at puberty. They can refer your child to a specialist, usually a consultant in paediatric endocrinology or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of different healthcare professionals will work with you to understand your child's condition, and offer you and your child support and advice. As your child grows up, they may need hormone therapy and psychological support, and they may eventually decide they want surgery to change their appearance. With the right care and support, many people with DSDs come to terms with their condition and live happily. If you think or know you have a DSD, help and support is available. Speak to your GP initially, as they'll be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals who can offer support and advice. Most people with a DSD stay with the gender they were assigned as a baby, but if you feel the gender you were assigned doesn't represent who you are, you may wish to change your gender. This will be something you can discuss with your care team. If you have a DSD, you may be infertile, and may need hormone therapy and psychological support. The right care and support can help you come to terms with your condition and lead a normal life. If you have a DSD or you're the parent of a child with a DSD, you may find it useful to contact or join a support group. These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and may be able to put you in contact with others who've been in a similar situation to you. National DSD support groups include: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Group DSD Families MRKH UK You may also want to ask your care team about support groups in your local area. Disorders of sex development is a new term increasingly used by doctors to describe a group of conditions where the development of the reproductive organs is different from what's usually expected. But not everyone agrees with the word \"disorder\" and some people prefer to use terms like \"differences in sex development\" or \"diversity of sex development\". Others find the word \"intersex\" a more helpful way to describe themselves. Your doctor should explain the different terms used, and you can choose which you feel most comfortable with. Page last reviewed: 05/10/2016 Next review due: 05/10/2019 ","Female genes with ambiguous or male-looking genitals":"Some people have XX (female) chromosomes with normal ovaries and womb, but their genitals may not be what's usually expected in females. For example, they may have an enlarged clitoris resembling a penis and their vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). If your child has CAH, they lack a particular enzyme their body needs to make hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Without these, the body produces more androgens (male sex hormones). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth cause the genitals to become more male in appearance. CAH can also lead to serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible. For support and more information on CAH, you can visit the CAH support group.

Types of physiotherapy recommended for AS include: a group exercise programme \u2013 where you exercise with others an individual exercise programme \u2013 you are given exercises to do by yourself massage \u2013 your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement; the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with AS hydrotherapy \u2013 exercise in water, usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath; the buoyancy of the water helps make movement easier by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your muscles  Some people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. This is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important. If you're ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise. The National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS) provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.  You may need painkillers to manage your condition while you're being referred to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time. ","Paracetamol":"If NSAIDs are unsuitable for you, an alternative painkiller, such as paracetamol, may be recommended. Paracetamol rarely causes side effects and can be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, paracetamol may not be suitable for people with liver problems or those dependent on alcohol. ","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)":"The first type of painkiller usually prescribed is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). As well as helping ease pain, NSAIDs can help relieve swelling (inflammation) in your joints. Examples of NSAIDs include: ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac etoricoxib When prescribing NSAIDs, your GP or rheumatologist will try to find the one that suits you and the lowest possible dose that relieves your symptoms. Your dose will be monitored and reviewed as necessary. ","URL":"/conditions/Ankylosing-spondylitis","Codeine":"If necessary, you may also be prescribed a stronger type of painkiller called codeine as well as paracetamol. Codeine can cause side effects, including:  feeling sick vomiting constipation drowsiness If your symptoms can't be controlled using painkillers or exercising and stretching, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) medication may be recommended. TNF is a chemical produced by cells when tissue is inflamed. Anti-TNF medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of TNF, as well as reducing the inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis. Examples of anti-TNF medication include: adalimumab etanercept golimumab certilizumab These are relatively new treatments for AS and their long-term effects are unknown. However, they have been used for longer in people with rheumatoid arthritis and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety. If your rheumatologist recommends using anti-TNF medication, the decision about whether they're right for you must be discussed carefully, and your progress will be closely monitored. In rare cases anti-TNF medication can interfere with the immune system, increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance about the use of anti-TNF medication for AS. NICE states adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab may only be used if: your diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis has been confirmed your level of pain is assessed twice (using a simple scale that you fill in) 12 weeks apart and confirms your condition has not improved your Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is tested twice, 12 weeks apart, and confirms your condition has not improved \u2013 BASDAI is a set of measures devised by experts to evaluate your condition by asking a number of questions about your symptoms treatment with two or more NSAIDs for four weeks at the highest possible dose has not controlled your symptoms After 12 weeks of treatment with anti-TNF medication, your pain score and BASDAI will be tested again to see whether they've improved enough to make continuing treatment worthwhile. If they have, treatment will continue and you'll be tested every 12 weeks. If there's not enough improvement after 12 weeks, you'll be tested again at a later date or the treatment will be stopped. Corticosteroids have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with AS. If a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. You'll need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours after the injection. It's usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. This is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as: infection in response to the injection the skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation) the surrounding tissue may waste away a tendon near the joint may burst (rupture) Corticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis. DMARDs may be prescribed for AS, although they're only beneficial in treating pain and inflammation in joints in areas of the body other than the spine. Sulfasalazine is the main DMARD sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine. Most people with AS won't need surgery. However, joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affected joint if the joint has become severely damaged. For example, if the hip joints are affected, a hip replacement may be carried out. In rare cases corrective surgery may be needed if the spine becomes badly bent. As the symptoms of AS develop slowly and tend to come and go, you'll need to see your rheumatologist or GP for regular check-ups. They'll make sure your treatment is working properly and may carry out physical assessments to assess how your condition is progressing. This may involve further sets of the same blood tests or X-rays you had at the time of your diagnosis. Any complications of ankylosing spondylitis that arise will be treated as they develop.

AS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. It's also around three times more common in men than in women. The symptoms of AS can vary, but usually involve: back pain and stiffness pain and swelling in other parts of the body \u2013 caused by inflammation of the joints (arthritis) and inflammation where a tendon joins a bone (enthesitis) extreme tiredness (fatigue) These symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time. In some people the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse. Read about symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS. If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints (rheumatologist) for further tests and any necessary treatment. Further tests may include blood tests and imaging tests. Read about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis. It's not known what causes the condition, but there's thought to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27. Read about the causes of ankylosing spondylitis. There's no cure for AS and it's not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression. In most cases treatment involves a combination of: exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness physiotherapy \u2013 where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility medication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation \u2013 such as painkillers, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) medication and other forms of biological therapy Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon. Read about treating ankylosing spondylitis. The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others it can get progressively worse over time. Around 70-90% of people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However, some people eventually become severely disabled as a result of the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees. With modern treatments, AS doesn't normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems. For example, AS can lead to: weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) spinal fractures cardiovascular disease \u2013 a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels chest infections rarely, kidney disease Read about the complications of ankylosing spondylitis. If you have AS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

It can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions. Some complications associated with AS are outlined below. Although most people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, some people with the condition eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine. This usually only affects the lower back and is the result of the bones in the spine joining up (fusing). Fusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your posture becomes fixed in one position, although it doesn't lead to severe disability in most cases. In rare cases surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine. AS can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed. This can damage the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move. If a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial one. Iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with AS where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. It usually only affects one eye, rather than both. If you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). Your vision may also become blurred or cloudy. You should visit your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly. If your GP thinks you have iritis, they'll refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist, a medical doctor who specialises in eye problems, for treatment. Iritis can usually be treated with corticosteroid eye drops. Osteoporosis is where the bones become weak and brittle. In AS osteoporosis can develop in the spine and increase your risk of fracturing the bones in your backbone. The longer you have the condition, the more this risk increases. If you do develop osteoporosis, you'll usually need to take medication to help strengthen your bones. There are a number of medications that can be used to treat osteoporosis, which can be taken by mouth (orally) as tablets or given by injection. Read about treating osteoporosis. If you have AS, you may also have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke. Because of this increased risk, it's important to take steps to minimise your chances of developing CVD. Your rheumatologist, a specialist in treating muscle and joint conditions, can advise about lifestyle changes you should make to minimise your risk of developing a CVD. These changes may include: stopping smoking \u2013 if you smoke losing weight \u2013 if you are overweight or obese taking regular exercise \u2013 150 minutes of exercise a week can greatly increase your health making changes to your diet to keep other conditions you may have under control \u2013 such as diabetes or high blood pressure You may also be prescribed medication to reduce your blood pressure or blood cholesterol level. Cauda equina syndrome is a very rare complication of AS that occurs when nerves at the bottom of your spine become compressed (compacted). Cauda equina syndrome causes: pain or numbness in your lower back and buttocks weakness in your legs \u2013 which can affect your ability to walk urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence \u2013 when you cannot control your bladder or bowels See your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and you develop any of these symptoms. In very rare cases it's possible to develop a condition called amyloidosis as a complication of AS. Amyloid is a protein produced by cells in your bone marrow, the spongy material found in the centres of some hollow bones. Amyloidosis is a condition where amyloid builds up in organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:  fatigue weight loss fluid retention (oedema) shortness of breath numbness or tingling in the hands and feet Over time AS can increasingly affect your ability to work. Some people with the condition may be unable to work at all, and others may need to make changes to their working life, such as working part-time, working from home, or avoiding physically demanding work. When at work, it's important to maintain a good posture when sitting or standing for long periods of time. You should get up, stretch and move around regularly. This could mean adjusting your work station or ensuring you take regular breaks. Read about how to sit correctly. The National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS) has more information on living with Ankylosing Spondylitis, including advice about the condition and employment. Page last reviewed: 08/07/2016 Next review due: 08/07/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Ankylosing-spondylitis"},"Causes":{" ":"In ankylosing spondylitis (AS) several parts of the lower spine become inflamed, including the bones in the spine (vertebrae) and spinal joints. Over time this can damage the spine and lead to the growth of new bone. In some cases this can cause parts of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility (ankylosis). It's not known exactly what causes AS, but in many cases there seems to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27. Research has shown more than 9 out of 10 people with AS carry a particular gene known as human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27). Having this gene doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop AS. It's estimated 8 in every 100 people in the general population have the HLA-B27 gene, but most don't have AS. It's thought having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing AS. The condition may be triggered by one or more environmental factors, although it's not known what these are. Testing for this gene may be carried out if AS is suspected. However, this test isn't a very reliable method of diagnosing the condition because some people can have the HLA-B27 gene but not have ankylosing spondylitis. Read about how ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed. AS can run in families, and the HLA-B27 gene can be inherited from another family member. If you have AS and tests have shown you carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 20%. If you have AS but don't carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 10%. If you have a close relative who has AS, such as a parent or a brother or sister, you're three times more likely to develop the condition compared with someone who doesn't have a relative with the condition.

The first thing you should do if you think you have AS is to see your GP. They'll ask about your symptoms, including: what symptoms you're experiencing when they started how long you've had them Back pain associated with AS can be quite distinctive. For example, it usually doesn't improve with rest and may wake you up during the night. If your GP suspects AS, they may arrange blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body. Inflammation in your spine and joints is one of the main symptoms of the condition. If your results suggest you do have inflammation, you'll be referred to a rheumatologist for further tests. A rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints. Your rheumatologist will carry out imaging tests to examine the appearance of your spine and pelvis, as well as further blood tests. These may include: an X-ray a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan an ultrasound scan ","Genetic testing":"A genetic blood test may sometimes be carried out to see if you carry the HLA-B27 gene, which is found in most people with AS. This can contribute towards a diagnosis of AS, but it's not entirely reliable as not everyone with the condition has this gene and some people have the gene without ever developing AS. Although scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine can't always be picked up in the early stages of AS. This is why diagnosis is often difficult. In many cases confirming a diagnosis is a long process that can take years. A diagnosis of AS can usually be confirmed if an X-ray shows inflammation of the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis) and you have at least one of the following: at least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn't improve with rest limited movement in your lower back (lumbar spine) limited chest expansion compared with what is expected for your age and sex If you have all three of these features but don't have sacroiliitis \u2013 or if you only have sacroiliitis \u2013 you'll be diagnosed with probable ankylosing spondylitis.

The symptoms may come and go, and improve or get worse, over many years. AS usually first starts to develop during the later teenage years or early adulthood. The main symptoms of AS are described below, although you may not develop all of these if you have the condition. Back pain and stiffness are usually the main symptoms of AS. You may find: the pain gets better with exercise, but doesn't improve or gets worse with rest the pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night \u2013 you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain you have pain in the area around your buttocks As well as causing symptoms in your back and spine, AS can also cause inflammation of the joints (arthritis) in other parts of your body, such as your hips and knees. The main symptoms associated with arthritis are: pain on moving the affected joint tenderness when the affected joint is examined swelling and warmth in the affected area   Enthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones). Common sites for enthesitis are: at the top of the shin bone behind the heel (Achilles tendon) under the heel where the ribs join the breast bone If your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain and find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply.

Most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin. At first, you'll have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving. Your GP or nurse will give the injections. After this initial period, your treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency is related to your diet. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK is pernicious anaemia, which isn't related to your diet. Read more about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. ","Not diet-related":"If your vitamin B12 deficiency isn't caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you'll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life. If you've had neurological symptoms (symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness or tingling in your hands and feet) caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you'll be referred to a haematologist, and you may need to have injections every two months. Your haematologist will advise on how long you need to keep taking the injections. For injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer. If you need regular injections of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months. Cyanocobalamin injections aren't routinely available on the NHS. However, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin B12, these will be cyanocobalamin. To treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid tablets to build up your folate levels. They may also give you dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake. Good sources of folate include: broccoli Brussels sprouts asparagus peas chickpeas brown rice Most people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. However, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer \u2013 possibly for life. Before you start taking folic acid, your GP will check your vitamin B12 levels to make sure they're normal. This is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency. If a vitamin B12 deficiency isn't detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system. To ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have further blood tests. A blood test is often carried out around 10-14 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working. This is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood. Another blood test may also be carried out after approximately eight weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful. If you've been taking folic acid tablets, you may be tested again once the treatment has finished (usually after four months). Most people who have had a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency won't need further monitoring unless their symptoms return, or their treatment is ineffective. If your GP feels it's necessary, you may have to return for an annual blood test to see whether your condition has returned.

Alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year. People who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life. Although it's less common, people with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and their diet has improved. Good sources of vitamin B12 include: meat salmon and cod milk and other dairy products eggs If you're a vegetarian or vegan, or are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin B12, such as yeast extract (including Marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products. Check the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12 different foods contain. "},"Introduction":{" ":"Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that can't function properly. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin. Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs when the body doesn't contain enough iron. Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including: extreme tiredness a lack of energy pins and needles (paraesthesia) a sore and red tongue mouth ulcers muscle weakness disturbed vision psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion  problems with memory, understanding and judgement Some of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don't have anaemia. Read about the symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. See your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.

Folate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn't involve eating good sources of folate. ","Excessive urination":"You may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as: congestive heart failure \u2013 where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body acute liver damage \u2013 often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol long-term dialysis \u2013 where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the blood ","Conditions affecting the stomach":"Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of enough vitamin B12. For example, a gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency. ","Conditions affecting the intestines":"Some conditions that affect your intestines can also stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin B12. For example, Crohn's disease (a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes mean your body doesn't get enough vitamin B12. ","Medication":"Some types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb. These include some anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary. ","Functional vitamin B12 deficiency":"Some people can experience problems related to a vitamin B12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin B12 in their blood. This can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 where there's a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin B12 between cells. This results in neurological complications involving the spinal cord. Folate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Your body's store of folate is usually enough to last four months. This means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin. Like vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. Some are described below. ","Malabsorption":"Sometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such as coeliac disease. ","Other causes":"Your body sometimes requires more folate than normal. This can cause folate deficiency if you can't meet your body's demands for the vitamin. Your body may need more folate than usual if you: are pregnant (see below) have cancer have a blood disorder \u2013 such as sickle cell anaemia (an inherited blood disorder which causes red blood cells to develop abnormally) are fighting an infection or health condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) Premature babies (born before the 37th week of pregnancy) are also more likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal. ","URL":"/conditions/Anaemia-vitamin-B12-and-folate-deficiency","Pernicious anaemia":"Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK. Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. An autoimmune condition means your immune system (the body's natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body's healthy cells. In your stomach, vitamin B12 is combined with a protein called intrinsic factor. This mix of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum. Pernicious anaemia causes your immune system to attack the cells in your stomach that produce the intrinsic factor, which means your body is unable to absorb vitamin B12. The exact cause of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such as Addison's disease or vitiligo. "},"Title":"Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia","Diagnosis":{" ":"A diagnosis of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can often be made by your GP based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests. Different types of blood tests can be carried out to help identify people with a possible vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These tests check: whether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen) than normal whether your red blood cells are larger than normal the level of vitamin B12 in your blood the level of folate in your blood However, some people can have problems with their normal levels of these vitamins or may have low levels despite having no symptoms. This is why it's important for your symptoms to be taken into account when a diagnosis is made. A particular drawback of testing vitamin B12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood. This means it measures forms of vitamin B12 that are \"active\" and can be used by your body, as well as the \"inactive\" forms, which can't. If a significant amount of the vitamin B12 in your blood is \"inactive\", a blood test may show that you have normal B12 levels, even though your body can't use much of it. There are some types of blood test that may help determine if the vitamin B12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren't yet widely available. If your symptoms and blood test results suggest a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, your GP may arrange further tests. If the cause can be identified, it will help to determine the most appropriate treatment. For example, you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you're unable to absorb vitamin B12 from the food you eat. Tests for pernicious anaemia aren't always conclusive, but they can often give your GP a good idea of whether you have the condition. You may be referred to a specialist for further tests or treatment. This may include: a haematologist (specialist in treating blood conditions) \u2013 if you have vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia and your GP is uncertain of the cause, you're pregnant or symptoms suggest your nervous system has been affected a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) \u2013 if your GP suspects you don't have enough vitamin B12 or folate because your digestive system isn't absorbing it properly a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) \u2013 if your GP suspects you have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor diet A dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin B12 or folate in your diet.

Anaemia is where you have fewer red blood cells than normal or you have an abnormally low amount of a substance called haemoglobin in each red blood cell. General symptoms of anaemia may include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) lack of energy (lethargy) breathlessness feeling faint headaches pale skin noticeable heartbeats (palpitations) hearing sounds coming from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus) loss of appetite and weight loss If you have anaemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you may have other symptoms in addition to those listed above, such as: a pale yellow tinge to your skin a sore and red tongue (glossitis) mouth ulcers pins and needles (paraesthesia) changes in the way that you walk and move around disturbed vision irritability depression changes in the way you think, feel and behave a decline in your mental abilities, such as memory, understanding and judgement (dementia) Some of these symptoms can also occur in people who have a vitamin B12 deficiency, but have not developed anaemia. Additional symptoms in people with anaemia caused by a folate deficiency can include: symptoms related to anaemia reduced sense of taste diarrhoea numbness and tingling in the feet and hands muscle weakness depression See your GP if you're experiencing symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.

You probably won\u2019t feel any pain or notice anything different. Screening is a way of detecting an aneurysm early. An AAA might be picked up by chance while you are being tested for another problem \u2013 for example, if you are given a chest scan because of a persistent cough. If the abdominal aortic artery gets particularly swollen, you might feel a pulsating feeling or pain in your stomach (abdomen) or back pain. If you don't experience this, you won\u2019t know you have an aneurysm until it bursts, when it becomes an emergency and is usually fatal. More than 8 out of 10 people with a ruptured AAA either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive emergency surgery. However, if an aneurysm is found before it ruptures it can be treated \u2013 usually by surgery. During this procedure, the swollen section of the aorta is either replaced or strengthened with a section of synthetic tubing. Because men aged over 65 are particularly at risk of developing an aneurysm, the NHS offers men in this age group screening in order to find aneurysms early, so they can be checked regularly or treated. The easiest way to find out if you have an aneurysm is to have a screening test, where an ultrasound scan of your abdomen is taken. The NHS AAA Screening Programme was introduced after research showed it could halve the number of deaths from burst aneurysms among men aged 65 and over. Men are approximately six times more likely to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm than women. The chance of having an aneurysm increases with age. The risk of having an abdominal aortic aneurysm can also increase if: you smoke you have high blood pressure a brother, sister or parent has, or has had, an abdominal aortic aneurysm Read more about the risk factors for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Screening is a choice and all screening involves a balance of potential harms, as well as benefits. The UK research study, which was set up to find out whether a national AAA screening programme would be worthwhile, has now been running for over 10 years, and shows that it will cut the risk of dying from an AAA by 48% in men over the age of 65. There is no risk from the scan itself. However, if you find out from the scan that you have a large aneurysm, it could lead to difficult decisions about having surgery, which has its own risks. Being told you have a life-threatening condition can also cause considerable anxiety. It\u2019s important to consider all the information carefully, and you will be sent an information leaflet with your screening letter to help you make this decision. If you decide you don\u2019t want to be tested, you can phone your local screening service and ask to be removed from its list of men to invite.

This is why the NHS AAA Screening Programme offers screening to men aged 65 and over. Men are invited for screening during the year they turn 65 (April 1 to March 31). This means you\u2019ll either be invited when you\u2019re 64 or just after your 65th birthday. If you\u2019re registered with a GP, you will receive a letter from the NHS AAA Screening Programme inviting you for an appointment at a local screening clinic, which might be at your own GP surgery. If you don\u2019t respond to this first invitation, you will be sent a second invitation within six weeks. Men over 65 who haven\u2019t already been screened can request a scan by contacting their local AAA screening service directly. ","Why aren\u2019t women or younger men screened?":"Women and younger men are not invited for screening because 95% of ruptured AAAs occur in men aged 65 and over. Men are six times more likely to have an AAA than women, and the chance of having an aneurysm increases with age. All the risks and benefits are carefully studied before a new screening programme is introduced. This is to ensure that the benefits of being offered screening outweigh any potential harms.

This swelling is far more common in men aged over 65 than it is in women and younger men, so men are invited for screening in the year they turn 65. An AAA usually causes no symptoms, but if it bursts, it\u2019s extremely dangerous and usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a ruptured AAA either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. Read more about abdominal aortic aneurysm. Screening involves a simple ultrasound scan of your stomach (abdomen), which takes about 10-15 minutes. If your abdominal aorta is not enlarged, you don\u2019t ever need to be tested again. If you have a small to medium aneurysm, you'll be regularly monitored to check it doesn\u2019t get dangerously larger. If you are found to have a large aneurysm, you'll be seen by a vascular surgeon (a specialist in blood vessels) within two weeks. They will advise on whether you would benefit from treatment to reduce the risk of it bursting. ","Results":"What happens next depends on the size of your abdominal aorta: If it\u2019s normal, you won\u2019t ever be invited for another screening. An aneurysm grows so slowly that you\u2019re unlikely to develop one after the age of 65. If you have a small to medium-sized aneurysm, you\u2019ll be invited back for regular scans to check its size. If you have a large AAA, you\u2019ll be referred to hospital to be seen by a vascular surgeon within two weeks. You will then be advised about treatment options but, generally, men with a large AAA are advised that the risk of a large aneurysm rupturing is more dangerous than having surgery to repair it.

Details are available below: NI Direct for details of the programme in Northern Ireland NHS Inform for details of the programme in Scotland Wales Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme  The UK National Screening Committee assesses all the research evidence, pilot programmes and economic evaluations before recommending that a new screening programme be introduced. The committee decided that an AAA screening programme will deliver benefits at a reasonable cost. It\u2019s estimated that the programme will reduce the death rate from ruptured AAAs among men aged 65 and over by up to 50% and prevent around 2,000 premature deaths a year. Read more about the research on AAA screening. AAA screening is offered to all men in England during the year they turn 65. Men who receive a normal result do not need another scan. Men over 65 who haven\u2019t previously been screened can contact their local screening service without going through their GP. The programme targets men aged 65 and over because 95% of ruptured aortic aneurysms occur in this group. Men are also six times more likely to have an aneurysm than women. Ruptured AAAs are less common in women and, on average, occur 10 years later than in men. There is no evidence to show that inviting women or men who are younger than 65 for screening would deliver major benefits. However, the risk of developing an aneurysm is higher if you have a close relative \u2013 brother, sister or parent \u2013 who has or has had one. This means you can have an ultrasound scan. Speak to your GP to discuss a referral. You are advised to request a scan at the age that is five years younger than your brother, sister or parent was diagnosed. Close relatives of men with an AAA should take the usual health precautions of not smoking, having a cholesterol and blood pressure check, and staying healthy. GPs can advise people to stop driving, and also whether a health condition must be reported to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Motor insurers cannot ask questions about health conditions, and so do not adjust premiums on that basis. The DVLA policy on AAAs states that: the DVLA must be informed if the aneurysm grows to 6cm the person's licence will be suspended if their aneurysm grows to 6.5cm their licence will be reinstated after their aneurysm has been successfully treated The policy on bus, coach and lorry drivers states that: the DVLA must be informed if they have an aneurysm of any size the person's licence will be suspended if their aneurysm grows to 5.5cm the person's licence will be reinstated after their aneurysm has been successfully treated The screening programme refers men to vascular surgeons if their aneurysm reaches 5.5cm. The DVLA policy does not affect car drivers with small or medium aneurysms (3.0-5.4cm) who are part of the programme's surveillance group. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has been advised that AAAs are no more likely to rupture at altitude than on the ground, and it is not aware of any airlines operating a standing rule about refusing patients with this condition.  The ABI is also unaware of any travel insurance policies that contain a specific exclusion for AAAs as part of their standard wording.  If an applicant for travel insurance declares an AAA, the ABI understands that the medical screening process does not ask the diameter of the aneurysm, because to do so would be to expect a degree of medical knowledge on the part of the patient that they might not have. Patients are instead asked whether or not they have had definitive treatment, such as surgery, and if so, when. They are also asked if they are on a waiting list for such treatment and if they have any other related cardiovascular diseases. The ABI suggests that anyone with an AAA should declare the condition during the travel insurance application process, or when it has been diagnosed, if they have an existing travel policy. Where an applicant declares an AAA, they may be charged an additional premium or have the condition excluded from cover. When looking for cover, a broker can help. The British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA) operates a \"find a broker\" service that can help and can be contacted on 0870 950 1790. At the screening clinic, you will be asked to give your permission: for the programme to store and keep information about you and your visit on the national AAA screening IT system, and to use this information to help offer safe and effective screening for the programme to screen you for an AAA (which involves an ultrasound scan of your abdomen) and to inform you of the result if you are found to have an AAA, to share your personal information with a vascular surgeon through the National Vascular Registry Men will only be screened if they give their consent to all three of the points above. You will also be asked if the NHS AAA Screening Programme can use your information to contact you in the future to let you know about research that is going on in the programme. You do not have to give permission for this to be screened. Screening is a diagnostic procedure that requires the person\u2019s consent. There is an associated duty of care to record information to provide evidence of what is done, what is found, and to share this with appropriate healthcare providers, so any findings can be followed up.  Recording data enables the programme to ensure that screening, assessment and treatment are effective and timely. The abdominal scan is only one part of a systematic pathway of care. It would be irresponsible and potentially negligent to offer a scan without ensuring that the safeguards offered by an assured national system are in place. The screening programme needs to retain personal data so it knows if and when a man has been scanned, and if he has declined screening. It also allows local programmes to keep track of who has, or has not, been invited for screening and deal with follow-up enquiries. Personal information is only available to healthcare professionals involved in an individual man's screening or any subsequent assessment or treatment. The programme controls and processes personal information in a manner that is compatible with the Data Protection Act (the data controller). The programme uses a third party (Northgate Public Services) to process and manage this personal information in a secure database. Although the database is a national system, strict data governance means that personal details can only be accessed by staff involved directly in an individual man's screening process. If a man is screened and found to have an aneurysm, it will be necessary to share his information with a vascular unit to support further investigation and potential surgery. Men may decide, after they have been invited or attended screening, that they do not want the NHS AAA Screening Programme to contact them again in the future or provide any ongoing care for them \u2013 either directly, or via any other healthcare professional. Men who ask to be removed from the screening invitation or recall process will be given information about the risks of their decision. Requests for removal must be made in writing to their local screening unit. Men can subsequently request to be reinstated into the screening invitation and recall process at any time. The NHS AAA Screening Programme works closely with medical researchers to improve screening and the care of men being screened for AAA and men with AAAs. If men give permission for the programme to contact them about research, they may be sent information about ongoing research and how they can get involved, if they wish to do so. All involvement in NHS research is optional. The decision to participate in research or not does not affect the care men receive from the NHS. Men who give their permission to be contacted about research will be able to decide whether to participate on a project-by-project basis. The programme does not pass any personal information on to medical researchers directly. All research projects must first be approved by the NHS AAA Screening Programme Research Committee. The programme has an obligation to monitor its own performance and determine if it can be improved or refined. This ensures the service is of good quality and achieving its main aim of preventing men dying from the complications of having an aneurysm. One of the ways the programme measures performance is by monitoring what happens to men who have been invited for screening. It does this by obtaining information for men invited for screening from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). This information is either held by the HSCIC directly (data on hospital admissions, which is collected from all NHS Hospitals) or obtained from other government organisations (data on deaths are held by the Office for National Statistics). To ensure confidentiality, the programme anonymises the data by removing information such as men's names and dates of birth. It only passes NHS numbers on to the HSCIC, which it uses to link to health records. The HSCIC matches the information provided with the information it holds and, again, removes all identifiable information, including NHS numbers. Anonymous data from the programme and the HSCIC is then passed to the University of Leicester, the programme\u2019s current academic partner. The University of Leicester analyses this information and provides the programme with a report on its performance. At no point will an individual man's identity be known to the analysis team at the University of Leicester. All data is held securely at the University of Leicester and is not made available to any other parties at any time. The data resulting from this process will be held for a maximum of 20 years. This is because aneurysms develop very slowly and it takes a long time to properly assess the full benefits of the screening programme. If you do not want your anonymised healthcare data used in this way, then please contact your local screening service. No, during the ultrasound scan (the screening test), the technician only looks at your aorta specifically to check if you have an AAA. If you have any concerns about your health, speak to your GP.

An anticoagulant is a medicine that stops blood clotting. Clotting (thickening) is a complex process involving a number of substances called clotting factors. Clotting factors are produced by the liver and help control bleeding. They work with cells that trigger the clotting process (platelets) to ensure blood clots effectively. To produce some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K. Warfarin blocks one of the enzymes (proteins) that uses vitamin K to produce clotting factors. This disrupts the clotting process, making it take longer for the blood to clot. This page covers: When warfarin is prescribed Taking warfarin Side effects of warfarin Interactions Other useful information Anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin, are often prescribed for people who've had a condition caused by a blood clot, such as: a stroke a heart attack deep vein thrombosis \u2013 a blood clot within a deep vein in the body, usually in a leg pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the lungs Warfarin may also be prescribed for people at an increased risk of developing harmful blood clots, such as those with: a replacement or mechanical (prosthetic) heart valve an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation a blood clotting disorder, such as thrombophilia an increased risk of blood clots following surgery It's very important that you take warfarin exactly as directed. Don't increase your prescribed dose unless the doctor in charge of your care advises you to. Warfarin is taken once a day, usually in the evening. It's important to take your dose at the same time each day, before, during or after a meal. The aim of warfarin therapy is to decrease the blood's tendency to clot, but not stop it clotting completely. This means the dose of warfarin you're taking must be carefully monitored and, if necessary, adjusted. You'll have regular blood tests at your GP surgery or local anticoagulant clinic to make sure your dose is correct. The international normalised ratio (INR) is a measure of how long it takes your blood to clot. The longer it takes your blood to clot, the higher your INR. Your INR will be used to determine the dose of warfarin you need to take. Although there are now three new anticoagulants that don't require regular monitoring \u2013 rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran \u2013 most people who need an anticoagulant will be prescribed warfarin. When you start taking warfarin, you may be given a yellow booklet about anticoagulants, which explains your treatment. How long you'll need to take warfarin for will depend on the condition for which it's been prescribed. Ask the healthcare professional responsible for your care if you're not sure. ","Playing sports":"You can play sports while taking warfarin, but because of the risk of bleeding: contact sports that could lead to a head injury, such as football, rugby, cricket and hockey, are best avoided if played competitively martial arts and kickboxing must be avoided You can continue to take part in non-contact sports, such as running, athletics, cycling and racquet sports. However, make sure you wear protective clothing, such as a cycle helmet. ","Food and drink":"Some food and drink can interfere with the effect of warfarin if consumed in large amounts, including foods that are rich in vitamin K. Foods containing large amounts of vitamin K include: green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach vegetable oils cereal grains Small amounts of vitamin K can also be found in meat and dairy foods. When your first dose of warfarin is prescribed, it doesn't matter how much vitamin K you're eating because the dosage will be based on your current blood clotting levels. However, if you make significant changes to your diet, such as increasing your vitamin K intake or cutting out foods that contain vitamin K, it could interfere with how warfarin works. Consult the healthcare professional responsible for your care before making any significant changes to your diet while taking warfarin. They'll also be able to give you more information about foods to avoid or limit. ","Who shouldn't take warfarin":"The following people shouldn't take warfarin: pregnant women \u2013 it can affect the development of the baby people with uncontrolled high blood pressure (severe hypertension) people with a high risk of internal bleeding \u2013 for example, those with a stomach ulcer people with a bleeding disorder \u2013 such as haemophilia Bleeding is the main side effect associated with warfarin, as it slows down the blood's normal clotting ability. You're at greatest risk of bleeding in the first few weeks of starting treatment with warfarin and when you're unwell. You should therefore seek medical attention if you: pass blood in your urine or faeces pass black faeces have severe bruising have long nosebleeds \u2013 lasting more than 10 minutes have bleeding gums cough up blood or have blood in your vomit experience unusual headaches have heavy or increased bleeding during your period, or any other bleeding from your vagina (in women) Take extra care to avoid cutting yourself while taking anticoagulant medication because of the risk of excessive bleeding. For example, you should: take care when shaving and brushing your teeth wear protective clothing when gardening, sewing or playing contact sports use insect repellent to avoid insect bites or stings Seek urgent medical attention if you're taking warfarin and you: have a fall or accident experience a significant blow to your head are unable to stop any bleeding have signs of bleeding, such as bruising Skin rashes and hair loss are also common side effects of warfarin. Contact your GP or the healthcare specialist responsible for your care if you experience any persistent side effects while taking warfarin. ","Medicines":"Warfarin can interact with many other medicines. The patient information leaflet that comes with a medicine should tell you if it's safe to take with warfarin. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure. When taking warfarin: don't take aspirin, or treatments containing aspirin, unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional as it could cause bleeding  don't take ibuprofen unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional you can take paracetamol, but don't take more than the recommended dose Herbal medicines and supplements can also interact with warfarin. You should therefore avoid taking them without first checking with your GP, pharmacist, or staff at your local anticoagulant clinic. ","Body piercings":"Body piercings aren't recommended while taking warfarin because of the increased risk of bleeding and risk of infection. Page last reviewed: 16/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","Having vaccinations":"You can have vaccinations while taking warfarin. If the vaccine is normally given by injection into the muscle, then providing you're up to date with your INR testing (see above), and that the results are within the correct range, you can have the injection as normal into muscle. This is known as an intramuscular (IM) injection. Alternatively, the injection can be given into the layer of fat underneath your skin. This is known as a subcutaneous injection. Firm pressure applied to the site for 10 minutes after the vaccination may reduce potential bruising. ","Alcohol":"Getting drunk or binge drinking is dangerous while taking warfarin. It may increase the effect of the drug, increasing the risk of bleeding. The latest guidelines on drinking alcohol state that regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week (for both men and women) risks damaging your health. Fourteen units is equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine. Read more about units of alcohol. Heavy drinkers or people with liver disease who are taking warfarin shouldn't drink alcohol. ","Going on holiday":"Tell your GP or anticoagulant nurse if you're going on holiday, in this country or abroad, and arrange to have your INR checked before you go. If you're going to be away longer than a month, you may need to arrange to have your INR checked while you're away. Make sure you have enough warfarin tablets to last for the duration of your trip. ","Surgery and dental work":"Because of the risk of bleeding, your dose of warfarin may need to be lowered or stopped a few days before having an operation or dental work. Tell the surgeon or dentist that you're taking warfarin. You should also tell anyone else involved with your care, such as an anticoagulant nurse, if you need an operation so they can make arrangements. ","URL":"/conditions/Anticoagulants-warfarin-","Missed doses":"If you usually take warfarin in the morning and forget to take it at your normal time, take it as soon as you remember and continue as normal. However, if it's time to take your next dose, don't take a double dose to catch up, unless your GP has specifically advised you to. If you forget to take your dose of warfarin in the evening but remember before midnight on the same day, take the missed dose. If midnight has passed, leave that dose and take your normal dose the next day at the usual time. Ask your GP or staff at your local anticoagulant clinic if you're not sure what to do about a missed dose of warfarin. You can also call NHS 111 for advice. "},"Title":"Warfarin"},"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)":{"Treatment":{"Therapy":"As well as taking medication, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children, teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating additional problems, such as conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear with ADHD. Some of the therapies that may be used are outlined below. Psychoeducation means that you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and how it affects you. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition. Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD, and may involve teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management, which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD. If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good behaviour, and removal of a privilege for poor behaviour. For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities, and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress. If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to improve their attention and behaviour. You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD. These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10-12 parents. A programme usually consists of 10-16 meetings, which each last up to two hours. They aim to teach parents and carers about behaviour management (see above), while increasing confidence in your ability to help your child and improve your relationship.  Social skills training involves your child taking part in role play situations, and aims to teach them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. A CBT therapist would try to change how your child feels about a situation, which would in turn potentially change their behaviour. CBT can be carried out with a therapist individually or in a group. ","Other possible treatments":"There are other ways of treating ADHD that some people with the condition find helpful, such as cutting out certain foods and taking supplements. However, there's no strong evidence these work, and they shouldn't be attempted without medical advice. People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet. Don't cut out foods before seeking medical advice. Some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. For example, sugar, food colourings and additives, and caffeine are often blamed for aggravating hyperactivity, and some people believe they have intolerances to wheat or dairy products, which may add to their symptoms. If this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour this causes. Discuss this with your GP, who may refer you to a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). Some studies have suggested that supplements of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may be beneficial in people with ADHD, although the evidence supporting this is very limited. It's advisable to talk to your GP before using any supplements, because some can react unpredictably with medication or make it less effective. You should also remember that some supplements shouldn't be taken long term, as they can reach dangerous levels in your body. ","Medication":"There are five types of medication licensed for the treatment of ADHD: methylphenidate  dexamfetamine lisdexamfetamine atomoxetine guanfacine These medications aren't a permanent cure for ADHD, but may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills. Some medications need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended, to assess whether the medication is still needed. In the UK, all of these medications are licensed for use in children and teenagers. Atomoxetine is also licensed for use in adults who had symptoms of ADHD as children. If you weren't diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood, your GP and specialist can discuss which medications and therapies are suitable for you. If you or your child is prescribed one of these medications, you'll probably be given small doses at first, which may then be gradually increased. You or your child will need to see your GP for regular check-ups, to ensure the treatment is working effectively and to check for signs of any side effects or problems. Your specialist will discuss how long you should take your treatment but, in many cases, treatment is continued for as long as it is helping. Methylphenidate is the most commonly used medication for ADHD. It belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants that work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Methylphenidate can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of six. Although methylphenidate isn't licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. The medication can be taken as either immediate-release tablets (small doses taken two to three times a day), or as modified-release tablets (taken once a day in the morning, and they release the dose throughout the day). Common side effects of methylphenidate include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate loss of appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain trouble sleeping headaches stomach aches mood swings Dexamfetamine is also a stimulant medication, which works in a similar way to methylphenidate by stimulating areas of the brain that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Dexamfetamine can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of three. Although it's not licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. Dexamfetamine is usually taken as a tablet once or twice a day, although an oral solution is also available. Common side effects of dexamfetamine include: decreased appetite mood swings agitation and aggression dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Lisdexamfetamine is a similar medication to dexamfetamine, and works in the same way. It can be used by children with ADHD over the age of six if treatment with methylphenidate hasn't helped. You may continue to take it into adulthood if your doctor thinks you're benefitting from treatment. Lisdexamfetamine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once a day. Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include: decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain aggression drowsiness dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Atomoxetine works differently to other ADHD medications. It's known as a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which means it increases the amount of a chemical in the brain called noradrenaline. This chemical passes messages between brain cells, and increasing the amount can aid concentration and help control impulses. Atomoxetine can be used by teenagers and children over the age of six. It's also licensed for use in adults if symptoms of ADHD are confirmed. Atomoxetine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once or twice a day. Common side effects of atomoxetine include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate nausea and vomiting stomach aches trouble sleeping dizziness headaches irritability Atomoxetine has also been linked to some more serious side effects that it's important to look out for, including suicidal thoughts and liver damage. If either you or your child begin to feel depressed or suicidal while taking this medication, speak to your doctor. Guanfacine acts on part of the brain to improve attention and it also reduces blood pressure. It's used for ADHD in teenagers and children if other medicines are unsuitable or ineffective. Guanfacine is usually taken as a tablet once a day, in the morning or evening. Common side effects include: tiredness or fatigue headache abdominal pain dry mouth ","Tips for parents":"Be sure that your GP or specialist helps you understand the difference between ADHD and other problems your child may have. Think about who else needs to know about your child\u2019s ADHD, such as their school or nursery. Find out the side effects of any medication your child takes and what you need to look out for. Getting to know people at local support groups can stop you feeling isolated and unable to cope.   For information on local support groups, contact Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service (ADDISS) or call 020 8952 2800.   Read more about living with ADHD.

ADHD can be treated using medication or therapy, but a combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist, although the condition may be monitored by your GP.  "},"Introduction":{"Living with ADHD":"Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they can't help their behaviour. Some issues that may arise in day-to-day life include: getting your child to sleep at night getting ready for school on time listening to and carrying out instructions being organised social occasions shopping Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment.

Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Introduction ":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. ","How ADHD is treated":"Although there's no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. ","Getting help ":"Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn't necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It's also a good idea to speak to your GP if you're an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren't diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. ","What causes ADHD?":"The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy It's thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have ADHD. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"},"Causes":{"Causes of ADHD ":"The exact cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) isn't fully understood, although a combination of factors is thought to be responsible. ","Brain function and structure":"Research has identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition, although the exact significance of these isn't clear. For example, studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be smaller in people with ADHD, whereas other areas may be larger. Research has also shown that the brain may take an average of two to three years longer to mature in children with ADHD, compared to children who don't have the condition. Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have an imbalance in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain, or that these chemicals may not work properly. ","Genetics":"ADHD tends to run in families and, in most cases, it's thought the genes you inherit from your parents are a significant factor in developing the condition. Research shows that both parents and siblings of a child with ADHD are four to five times more likely to have ADHD themselves. However, the way ADHD is inherited is likely to be complex and isn't thought to be related to a single genetic fault. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder","Other possible causes":"Various other causes have also been suggested as playing a role in the development of ADHD, including: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight brain damage either in the womb or in the first few years of life drinking alcohol, smoking or misusing drugs while pregnant exposure to high levels of toxic lead at a young age However, the evidence for many of these factors is inconclusive, and more research is needed to determine if they contribute to ADHD.

If you're worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP, to find out if they have any concerns about your child's behaviour. Your GP can't formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. When you see your GP, they may ask you: about your symptoms or those of your child when these symptoms started where the symptoms occur \u2013 for example, at home or in school whether the symptoms affect your or your child\u2019s day-to-day life \u2013 for example, if they make socialising difficult if there have been any recent significant events in your life or your child's, such as a death or divorce in the family if there's a family history of ADHD about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have ","Diagnosis in children and teenagers":"Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have six or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have: been displaying symptoms continuously for at least six months started to show symptoms before the age of 12 been showing symptoms in at least two different settings \u2013 for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or parental control symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level symptoms that aren't just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and aren't better accounted for by another condition ","Assessment":"There are a number of different specialists that you or your child may be referred to for a formal assessment, including: a child or adult psychiatrist a paediatrician (a specialist in children's health) a learning disability specialist, social worker or occupational therapist with expertise in ADHD Who you're referred to depends on your age and what's available in your local area. There's no simple test to determine whether you or your child have ADHD, but your specialist can make an accurate diagnosis after a detailed assessment that may include: a physical examination, which can help rule out other possible causes for the symptoms a series of interviews with you or your child interviews or reports from other significant people, such as partners, parents and teachers The criteria for making a diagnosis of ADHD in children, teenagers and adults are outlined below. ","Diagnosis in adults":"Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there's some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults. In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have five or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or five or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, that are listed in diagnostic criteria for children with ADHD. As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults can't be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood. If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, or you weren't diagnosed with ADHD when you were younger, your specialist may wish to see your old school records or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child. For an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms should also have a moderate impact on different areas of their life, such as: underachieving at work or in education driving dangerously difficultly making or keeping friends difficulty in relationships with partners If your problems are recent and didn't occur regularly in the past, you're not considered to have ADHD. This is because it's currently not thought that ADHD can develop for the first time in adults. Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Next steps":"If your GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of \"watchful waiting\" lasting around 10 weeks \u2013 to see if your child's symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse. They may also suggest starting a parent training or education programme to teach you ways of helping your child (see treating ADHD for more information). If your child's behaviour doesn't improve, and both you and your GP believe it's seriously affecting their day-to-day life, your GP should refer you and your child to a specialist for a formal assessment (see below). For adults with possible ADHD, your GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if: you weren't diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since then your symptoms can't be explained by a mental health condition your symptoms have a significant impact on your day-to-day life \u2013 for example, if you're underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person, and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"},"Living with":{"Adults with ADHD":"If you're an adult living with ADHD, you may find the following advice useful: Make lists, keep diaries, stick up reminders and set aside some time to plan what you need to do if you find it hard to stay organised. Let off steam by exercising regularly. Find ways to help you relax, such as listening to music or learning relaxation techniques. If you have a job, speak to your employer about your condition, and discuss anything they can do to help you work better. Talk to your doctor about your suitability to drive, as you'll need to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if your ADHD affects your driving. Contact or join a local or national support group \u2013 these organisations can put you in touch with other people in a similar situation, and they can be a good source of support, information and advice. For more advice, you can read about living with ADHD on the AADD-UK website. AADD-UK is a charity specifically for adults with ADHD. AADD-UK also has a list of adult support groups across the UK. Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Living with ADHD ":"Caring for a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be draining. The impulsive, fearless and chaotic behaviours typical of ADHD can make normal everyday activities exhausting and stressful. ","Ways to cope":"Although it can be difficult at times, it's important to remember that a child with ADHD can't help their behaviour. People with ADHD find it difficult to suppress impulses, which means they don't stop to consider a situation or the consequences before they act. If you're looking after a child with ADHD, you may find the below advice helpful. Plan the day so your child knows what to expect. Set routines can make a difference to how a child with ADHD copes with everyday life. For example, if your child has to get ready for school, break it down into structured steps, so they know exactly what they need to do. Make sure everyone knows what behaviour is expected, and reinforce positive behaviour with immediate praise or rewards. Be clear, using enforceable consequences if boundaries are overstepped (such as taking away a privilege) and follow these through consistently. Give specific praise. Instead of saying a general, \"Thanks for doing that,\" you could say, \"You washed the dishes really well. Thank you.\" This will make it clear to your child that you're pleased, and why. If you're asking your child to do something, give brief instructions and be specific. Instead of asking, \"Can you tidy your bedroom?\" say, \"Please put your toys into the box, and put the books back onto the shelf.\" This makes it clearer what your child needs to do and creates opportunities for praise when they get it right. Set up your own incentive scheme using a points chart or star chart, so good behaviour can earn a privilege. For example, behaving well on a shopping trip will earn your child time on the computer or some sort of game. Involve your child in it and allow them to help decide what the privileges will be. These charts need regular changes or they become boring. Targets should be: immediate (for example, daily) intermediate (for example, weekly) long-term (for example, three-monthly) Try to focus on just one or two behaviours at a time. Watch for warning signs. If your child looks like they're becoming frustrated, overstimulated and about to lose self-control, intervene. Distract your child if possible, by taking them away from the situation, which may calm them down. Keep social situations short and sweet. Invite friends to play, but keep playtimes short, so your child doesn't lose self-control. Don't aim to do this when your child is feeling tired or hungry, such as after a day at school. Make sure your child gets lots of physical activity during the day. Walking, skipping and playing sport can help your child wear themselves out and improve their quality of sleep. Make sure they're not doing anything too strenuous or exciting near to bedtime. Read our page on health and fitness, which includes information on getting active, and how much activity you and your child should be doing. Keep an eye on what your child eats. If your child is hyperactive after eating certain foods, which may contain additives or caffeine, keep a diary of these and discuss them with your GP. Stick to a routine. Make sure your child goes to bed at the same time each night and gets up at the same time in the morning. Avoid overstimulating activities in the hours before bedtime, such as computer games or watching TV. Sleep problems and ADHD can be a vicious circle. ADHD can lead to sleep problems, which in turn can make symptoms worse. Many children with ADHD will repeatedly get up after being put to bed and have interrupted sleep patterns. Trying a sleep-friendly routine can help your child and make bedtime less of a battleground. Read more information about creating a bedtime ritual for better sleep. Children with ADHD often have problems with their behaviour at school, and the condition can have a negative impact on a child's academic progress. Speak to your child's teachers or their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) about any extra support your child may need. ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms in children and teenagers":"The symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are well defined, and they're usually noticeable before the age of six. They occur in more than one situation, such as at home and at school. The main signs of each behavioural problem are detailed below. The main signs of inattentiveness are: having a short attention span and being easily distracted making careless mistakes \u2013 for example, in schoolwork appearing forgetful or losing things being unable to stick at tasks that are tedious or time-consuming appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions constantly changing activity or task having difficulty organising tasks The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are: being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings constantly fidgeting being unable to concentrate on tasks excessive physical movement excessive talking being unable to wait their turn acting without thinking interrupting conversations little or no sense of danger These symptoms can cause significant problems in a child's life, such as underachievement at school, poor social interaction with other children and adults, and problems with discipline. ","Symptoms of ADHD ":"The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be categorised into two types of behavioural problems. These categories are: inattentiveness hyperactivity and impulsiveness Most people with ADHD have problems that fall into both these categories, but this isn't always the case. For example, some people with the condition may have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious. ","Related conditions in children and teenagers":"Although not always the case, some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, such as: anxiety disorder \u2013 which causes your child to worry and be nervous much of the time; it may also cause physical symptoms, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating and dizziness oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) \u2013 this is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers conduct disorder \u2013 this often involves a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals depression sleep problems \u2013 finding it difficult to get to sleep at night, and having irregular sleeping patterns autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) \u2013 this affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour epilepsy \u2013 a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits or seizures Tourette\u2019s syndrome \u2013 a condition of the nervous system, characterised by a combination of involuntary noises and movements called tics learning difficulties \u2013 such as dyslexia ","Symptoms in adults":"In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define. This is largely due to a lack of research into adults with ADHD. ADHD is a developmental disorder; it's believed that it can't develop in adults without it first appearing during childhood. But it's known that symptoms of ADHD often persist from childhood into a person's teenage years, and then adulthood. Any additional problems or conditions experienced by children with ADHD, such as depression or dyslexia, may also continue into adulthood. By the age of 25, an estimated 15% of people diagnosed with ADHD as children still have a full range of symptoms, and 65% still have some symptoms that affect their daily lives. The symptoms in children and teenagers, which are listed above, is sometimes also applied to adults with possible ADHD. But some specialists say that the way in which inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness affect adults can be very different from the way they affect children. For example, hyperactivity tends to decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to get worse as the pressure of adult life increases. Adult symptoms of ADHD also tend to be far more subtle than childhood symptoms. Some specialists have suggested the following list of symptoms associated with ADHD in adults: carelessness and lack of attention to detail continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones poor organisational skills inability to focus or prioritise continually losing or misplacing things forgetfulness restlessness and edginess difficulty keeping quiet and speaking out of turn blurting out responses and often interrupting others mood swings, irritability and a quick temper inability to deal with stress extreme impatience taking risks in activities, often with little or no regard for personal safety or the safety of others \u2013 for example, driving dangerously ","URL":"/conditions/Attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder","Additional problems in adults with ADHD":"As with ADHD in children and teenagers, ADHD in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions. One of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that adults may have alongside ADHD include: personality disorders \u2013 conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others bipolar disorder \u2013 a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) \u2013 a condition that causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour The behavioural problems associated with ADHD can also cause problems such as difficulties with relationships, social interaction, drugs and crime. Some adults with ADHD find it hard to find and stay in a job.

People with albinism should wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF). An SPF of 30 or more will provide the best protection. Sunscreen should be thickly applied at least 15 minutes before going out in the sun. For maximum protection, choose a lotion that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. You should also: avoid going out when it is very hot and the sun is at its strongest (between 11am and 3pm) when buying sunglasses, choose a pair that have UV filters when out in the sun, cover up with a hat and loose-fitting clothing, such as a long-sleeved top Read more about preventing sunburn.

","URL":"/conditions/albinism","Eye problems":"Many babies with albinism may seem to have severely impaired vision during the first few months of life, but their vision often improves significantly by the time they are a few months old. This is known as delayed vision maturation. However, their vision is unlikely to ever reach normal levels, so they may need help to improve their sight and adapt to their low vision. If the child is short-sighted (myopia) or long-sighted (hyperopia), glasses or contact lenses may improve their vision. Glasses or contact lenses can also be used to correct astigmatism, which is when the cornea (front of the eye) is not a perfectly curved shape. Regular eye tests will be needed to check the prescription of the glasses or lenses. See NHS opticians for more information about eye tests. As the vision of a person with albinism never fully develops, it is not possible for glasses or contact lenses to totally correct their vision. However, there are a number of low vision aids available, including: large-print or high-contrast (for example, white text on a black background) books and printed materials, such as school printouts and exam papers magnifying lenses a small telescope or telescopic lenses that attach to glasses to read writing in the distance, such as a school blackboard a special computer with a large screen, or software that can convert speech into typing or typing into speech tablets and smartphones that allow you to magnify the display to make writing and images easier to see  The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)  provides more information about living with low vision, including: making practical adaptations to your home, such as using bright colours for door frames, door handles, banisters and light switches specially adapted technology for people with vision problems, such as computers and phones advice about school options for a child with vision problems There is no reason why, with appropriate help and support, most children with albinism cannot attend a mainstream school. It may be possible to reduce a person's sensitivity to light (photophobia) by wearing sunglasses or tinted glasses. A wide-brimmed hat can also be worn outside. The hat's fabric should be a dark colour and not shiny, so less light is reflected into the eyes. A squint (strabismus) is where one eye looks in a different direction to the other. They are a common childhood condition and are often treated with glasses to correct the vision problems that may be causing the squint. If your child's squint has caused them to develop a \"lazy eye\" (where the vision in the affected eye gradually deteriorates because the brain ignores the signals being sent from it), they may also benefit from wearing a patch over their \"good\" eye to encourage their other eye to work harder. Patches are most effective before a child reaches seven or eight years of age. Most children will need to wear the patch for a few hours a day for several weeks. In some cases, surgery may be carried out to improve the alignment of the eyes and help them work together. Read more about squint surgery.  Nystagmus is involuntary eyes movements, usually from side to side. This causes reduced vision that glasses and contact lenses cannot correct. There is currently no cure for nystagmus, but it's not painful and does not get worse. There are certain toys or games that may help the child make the most of the vision they have. An ophthalmologist (a specialist in eye conditions and their treatment) will be able to provide further advice. Occasionally, surgery may be an option. There is a type of surgery called \"tenotomy of horizontal eye muscles\" that divides and then reattaches some of the eye muscles. The aim is to reduce the frequency and degree of eye movement. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said that while this procedure is safe, it is not yet clear how effective it is. For more information, see the NICE guidance about tenotomy of horizontal eye muscles for nystagmus.

People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin or no melanin at all, which can cause characteristic signs and symptoms often obvious from birth. Depending on the amount of melanin the person has, they may have very pale hair, skin and eyes, although some people with albinism can have brown or ginger hair and skin that can tan.

A person with albinism\u2019s vision is unlikely to ever reach normal levels, even with glasses or contact lenses, and a child with the condition will often need extra support at school. A child with albinism may also need support to help them deal with any bullying they may experience because they look different. However, there is usually no reason why a person with albinism cannot otherwise do well in normal schooling, further education and employment. ","Who is affected":"It is estimated that about one in every 17,000 people has some form of albinism. The condition generally affects both sexes equally, although there is one type \u2013 known as ocular albinism (which mainly affects the eyes) \u2013 that is more common in males. Albinism can affect people of all ethnic groups.

This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. ","URL":"/conditions/albinism","What causes albinism?":"In albinism, cells that produce melanin do not work properly because of inherited genetic mutations (faulty genes). There are a number of faulty genes that can cause albinism, and these are passed onto a child by their parents. Read more about the causes of albinism. ","Treatment for people with albinism":"Albinism itself does not need treatment, but the associated skin and eye problems it can cause often do. A child with albinism will need regular eye tests and it is likely they will need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness or astigmatism. Those with albinism will also need to take extra care in the sun. Without melanin, ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight can easily damage their skin (sunburn) and increase their risk of developing skin cancer. Read more about treating albinism. "},"Causes":{"Genetic counselling ":"If you have a history of albinism in your family, or you have a child with the condition, you may be referred for genetic counselling. Genetic counselling is a service that provides support, information and advice about genetic conditions. An adult or child diagnosed with albinism may also be referred for genetic counselling to discuss how the condition was inherited and what the chances are of passing the condition on. Read more about genetic testing and counselling. Page last reviewed: 04/11/2014 Next review due: 04/11/2017 ","How albinism is inherited":"In most cases, including all types of OCA and some types of OA, albinism is passed on in what is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. However, some types of OA are caused by a mutation on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes). This is known as an X-linked inheritance pattern. An autosomal recessive condition means you need to inherit two copies of the faulty gene (one from your mother and one from your father) to have the condition. It is estimated that about one in 70 people carry the faulty gene that causes OCA. Carriers of the gene are not affected by the condition and have a normal amount of melanin. If both parents carry the gene, there is a one in four chance that their child will have albinism and a one in two chance they will be a carrier. X-linked recessive conditions often don't affect females because females have two X chromosomes, one of which will be normal and can usually compensate for the mutated chromosome. However, females who inherit the mutation will become carriers. If a male inherits the mutation from his mother (males receive a Y chromosome from their fathers), he will not have a normal copy of the gene and will develop albinism. When a mother is a carrier of an X-linked mutation, each daughter they have has a one in two chance of becoming a carrier and each son they have has a one in two chance of having albinism. When a father has an X-linked condition, his daughters will become carriers of the mutation. ","Causes of albinism ":"Albinism is caused by a lack of the pigment melanin, which gives hair, skin and eyes their colour. Melanin is also involved in the development of the retina (the thin layer of nerve cells that line the inside of the back of the eye) and nerve connections between the retina and the brain, which is why most people with albinism have vision problems. In people with albinism, the cells that make melanin do not work due to a faulty (mutated) gene. There are two main types of albinism: oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) \u2013 the most common type that affects the skin, hair and eyes ocular albinism (OA) \u2013 a rarer type that mainly affects the eyes These two types are caused by different genetic faults, and they can be divided into many further sub-types that are caused by a number of different faulty genes. ","URL":"/conditions/albinism"},"Title":"Albinism","Diagnosis":{"Eye examination":"As albinism can cause a number of eye conditions, the baby\u2019s eyes will need to be examined to see how they are affected. They may be referred to an ophthalmologist for these tests. Ophthalmologists are doctors who specialise in diagnosing and treating eye conditions. They mainly work in hospitals and hospital eye departments. During the eye examination, the ophthalmologist may:  use eye drops to enlarge the baby\u2019s pupils examine the baby\u2019s eyes with a slit lamp, which is a microscope with a very bright light look for signs of nystagmus (where the eyes move uncontrollably, usually from side to side) look for signs of a squint (strabismus), which is where the eyes point in different directions look for signs of astigmatism, where the cornea (front of the eye) is not a perfectly curved shape Electrodiagnostic testing is also sometimes performed to help make the diagnosis. This is where small electrodes are stuck to the scalp to test the connections of the eyes to the part of the brain that controls vision. As the child gets older, they will need regular eye tests to monitor their vision, and may be prescribed glasses or contact lenses.  Page last reviewed: 04/11/2014 Next review due: 04/11/2017 ","Diagnosing albinism  ":"In most cases, albinism will be obvious from a baby's characteristics when they are born.

","URL":"/conditions/albinism"},"Symptoms":{"Hair and skin":"A person with albinism will often have white or very light blonde hair. However, some people have brown or ginger hair. The exact hair colour will depend on how much melanin their body produces. People with albinism also have very pale skin that will usually not tan and burns easily in the sun. ","Eyes":"A person with albinism is missing the pigment from their irises (the coloured part of the eye). As a result, they will usually have very pale blue or grey eyes. The missing pigment can also cause other eye conditions, such as: poor eyesight \u2013 either short-sightedness (myopia) or long-sightedness (hyperopia), and low vision (sight loss that cannot be corrected) astigmatism \u2013 where the cornea (front of the eye) is not a perfectly curved shape or the lens is an abnormal shape, causing blurred vision photophobia \u2013 where the eyes are sensitive to light nystagmus \u2013 where the eyes move uncontrollably from side to side, causing reduced vision; however, despite the eyes of a person with albinism constantly moving, they do not see the world as \"wobbling\" because their brain adapts to their moving eyes  squint \u2013 where the eyes point in different directions Young babies with albinism often appear to have severe vision problems and, although their sight tends to rapidly improve during the first six months, it will never usually reach normal levels. Young children with albinism may appear clumsy, because their reduced vision can affect their ability to learn certain actions and movements, such as picking up an object or learning how to crawl. But as the child develops, and with aids to help their vision, this should improve. ","Related conditions":"Signs and symptoms of albinism can also be found in people with similar conditions, such as Hermansky Pudlak syndrome (HPS) and Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). These are rare genetic conditions that can cause other symptoms in addition to the signs of albinism described above. HPS can also cause bleeding disorders, such as uncontrollable bleeding or bruising easily. It can also affect the heart, kidneys, lungs and gut. CHS can weaken the immune system and lead to an increased risk of infections. Speak to your GP if your child has albinism and you notice that they bleed a lot, bruise easily, or that they become ill frequently.

This involves combining conventional treatments with non-medical treatments, such as acupuncture. Complementary therapies can't slow the progression of motor neurone disease, but they may help reduce stress and make your daily life more comfortable. Before considering complementary therapy, you should seek advice from your treatment team and ensure that any practitioners you contact are appropriately registered, qualified and experienced. ","Treating symptoms":"A range of treatments can relieve many of the symptoms of motor neurone disease and improve your quality of life. Muscle cramps can be helped by physiotherapy and, in some cases, a medication called quinine. They typically improve later in the condition. Quinine can cause side effects, such as: hearing and vision problems tinnitus \u2013 the perception of noise in one ear, both ears or inside the head vertigo \u2013 a sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving   Because of this, quinine will usually only be used if the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. Muscle stiffness, also known as spasticity, can be treated using medication such as baclofen to help relax the muscles. Side effects may include increased weakness or tiredness. Drooling of watery saliva can be treated with a number of medications. One widely used medication is a hyoscine hydrobromide skin patch. It was originally designed to treat motion sickness, but has since proved useful in drying up the flow of saliva. Amitriptyline, atropine eye drops applied to the tongue, glycopyrrolate, or botulinum toxin injections are alternative medicines that can also be used to control drooling. Not everyone with motor neurone disease will have significant speech problems, but there's a lot of help for people who do. A speech and language therapist can teach you several techniques to make your voice as clear as possible. As motor neurone disease progresses, you may need assistive technology to help you communicate. A range of communication aids is available. Your therapist will be able to advise you about the most effective communication aids for you. Not everyone with motor neurone disease will have significant swallowing problems (dysphagia). For those that do, it can prevent normal eating and drinking. If food goes down the wrong way into the lungs it can cause chest infections (called aspiration). Weight loss due to poor nutrition can also accelerate motor neurone disease. One widely used treatment for dysphagia is a thin feeding tube known as a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The tube is surgically implanted into your stomach through a small cut on the surface of the stomach. It shouldn't restrict your daily activities and you can continue to bathe and swim normally if you wish. It's advisable to have the tube inserted before the breathing muscles are significantly weakened, even if it isn't used for feeding until sometime later. Motor neurone disease isn't usually a painful condition. If you experience pain, it's often aching joints caused by muscle weakness or a change in posture. The type of painkiller recommended will depend on how severe the pain is. Mild to moderate pain can often be controlled using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. More severe pain is very rare, but it can be treated using an opiate-based painkiller such as morphine. In some cases, a type of medication called gabapentin is used. It was originally designed to treat epilepsy but it's also useful for treating pain. Drowsiness is a typical side effect of gabapentin. ","Breathing difficulties":"As motor neurone disease progresses, the muscles that help you breathe will become weaker and your breathing will become increasingly shallow, with a weaker cough. Breathing difficulties usually develop gradually, although rarely they may be the first sign of motor neurone disease. It's important to discuss breathing problems with your GP before they occur. Your GP or neurologist should be able to refer you to a respiratory specialist or a palliative care specialist, as appropriate. Many people with motor neurone disease benefit from non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) to support their breathing, usually overnight when asleep. Room air (not oxygen) is sucked into a small box, filtered and then gently pumped into the lungs through a face mask or nasal tube each time the person takes a breath. NIV may not be suitable for everyone with motor neurone disease. Your respiratory or palliative care specialist will be able to discuss the options available to you. Deciding what treatment you want to use in the event of respiratory failure is an important part of drawing up a treatment plan and making an advance decision. This can be a very difficult and upsetting decision, and you may want to discuss it with your loved ones. Your care team can also give you information and advice but the final decision will be yours.

Side effects of riluzole are usually mild and commonly include nausea, tiredness and, less commonly, a rapid heartbeat. Very rarely, riluzole has been known to cause liver damage. If you're prescribed riluzole you'll need to have blood tests for the first few months to check your liver is working properly. If you've had significant liver disease, riluzole may not be suitable for you. ","URL":"/conditions/Motor-neurone-disease","Advance decision":"An important principle of medical care is that patients feel in charge of what is, and what isn't, done to them. Many people with motor neurone disease draw up an advance decision (sometimes called an advanced directive). This is where you make your treatment preferences known in advance in case you can't communicate your decisions later because you're too ill. Issues that can be covered by an advance decision include: whether you want to be treated at home, in a hospice or in a hospital once you reach the final stages of motor neurone disease the type of medication you'd be willing to take in certain circumstances whether you'd be willing to consider a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid if you have respiratory failure (loss of lung function) in the latter stages of motor neurone disease, whether you wish to be resuscitated by artificial means, such as having a permanent breathing tube inserted into your throat (known as a tracheostomy) whether you'd be willing to donate any of your organs after you die (the brain and spinal cord of people with motor neurone disease are very important for ongoing research) Your care team will be able to provide you with more information and advice about making an advance decision.

Common early symptoms include: a weakened grip, which can cause difficulty picking up or holding objects weakness at the shoulder that makes lifting the arm difficult a \"foot drop\" caused by weak ankle muscles dragging of the leg slurred speech (dysarthria) The condition isn't usually painful. As damage progresses, symptoms spread to other parts of the body and the condition becomes more debilitating. Eventually, a person with motor neurone disease may be unable to move. Communicating, swallowing and breathing may also become very difficult. In up to 15% of cases, motor neurone disease is associated with a type of dementia that can affect personality and behaviour. This is called frontotemporal dementia, and is often an early feature when it occurs in motor neurone disease. The affected person may not realise that their personality or behaviour is different. ","Introduction ":"Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. Motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), occurs when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord called motor neurones stop working properly. This is known as neurodegeneration. Motor neurones control important muscle activity, such as: gripping walking speaking swallowing breathing As the condition progresses, people with motor neurone disease will find some or all of these activities increasingly difficult. Eventually, they may become impossible. It's not clear what causes motor neurones to stop working properly. In about 5% of cases there's a family history of either motor neurone disease or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia. This is known as familial motor neurone disease. In most of these cases, faulty genes have been identified as making a major contribution to the development of the condition. There's no single test to diagnose motor neurone disease and diagnosis is based mainly on the opinion of a brain and nervous system specialist (a neurologist). The diagnosis of motor neurone disease is usually clear to an experienced neurologist, but sometimes specialised tests are needed to rule out other conditions with similar features.

Researchers believe that the cause is probably a series of steps involving a mixture of damaging genetic and environmental factors. As we get older, we may gradually lose the ability to keep this damage under control, triggering irreversible neurodegeneration. About 5% of people with motor neurone disease have a close family relative with the condition or a related condition known as frontotemporal dementia. This is called familial motor neurone disease which can be hereditary or linked to a problem with genes that can cause problems at a younger age. ","Possible causes of motor neurone disease":"It's still unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. Most experts believe that it's a combination of interrelated factors that ultimately affect either the motor neurones or the nerve cells that support them. Aggregates are abnormal clumps of protein that develop inside motor neurones. They are found in nearly all cases of motor neurone disease and may disrupt the normal working of the motor neurones, or at least be a marker that the cell is under great strain. The most common aggregate found is TDP-43, which is a very important protein involved in the correct processing of the genetic instructions for the cell through a molecule known as RNA. All cells contain transport systems that move nutrients and other chemicals into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Research suggests that the transport systems in motor neurones become disrupted. Over time, toxic waste can build up in cells as a natural by-product of normal cell activity. The body gets rid of the toxic waste by producing substances known as antioxidants, and packaging the waste into containers called microvesicles. Research suggests that in motor neurone disease the motor neurones may be deficient in antioxidants. However, there's no evidence that this is due to poor dietary intake. Glia are cells that surround and support motor neurones and provide them with nutrients. Glial cells also help relay information from one nerve cell to another. Some cases of motor neurone disease may be caused by problems with the glial cells, which means that the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition they need to function normally. Nerve cells use special \"messenger chemicals\" called neurotransmitters to pass information from one cell to another. One of the neurotransmitters is called glutamate. There's evidence that the motor neurones in people with motor neurone disease may have become more sensitive to glutamate, resulting in damage to these cells. However, this isn't linked to dietary intake of glutamate. Mitochondria are the \"batteries\" of cells. They provide the energy that a cell needs to carry out its normal function. Research has shown that the mitochondria in the motor neurones of people with motor neurone disease seem to become abnormal. ","Familial motor neurone disease":"The fact that motor neurone disease can run in families suggests that single genetic mutations inherited from parents may sometimes have a much larger role in the condition. A genetic mutation occurs when the instructions carried in cells become scrambled in some way. This results in one or more of the body's processes not working properly. Read more about genetics. Four major genetic mutations have so far been identified in the 5% of people with a family history of motor neurone disease or the related condition, frontotemporal dementia. The largest group (about one third) have an expanded area of a gene called C9ORF72. Some people with this gene abnormality develop motor neurone disease, some develop frontotemporal dementia and some develop both. Other genes linked to familial motor neurone disease include SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. If your father, mother, sister or brother developed motor neurone disease and were found to have one of these abnormal genes, you have a 50% chance of carrying the same gene. However, importantly, this doesn't necessarily mean you'll definitely develop motor neurone disease in your lifetime. If you've been diagnosed with motor neurone disease but there's no wider family history, the overall risk to your own children is currently thought to be similar to that of the general population. Genetic testing is available to determine whether you have one of the mutated genes associated with familial motor neurone disease. Your GP can give you more information about appropriate specialists who can help with the complex issue of when to perform genetic testing.

It may be that the initial symptoms aren't thought to be serious, or they're not recognised as being related to the nervous system so a neurologist isn't initially consulted. Sometimes, the diagnosis of motor neurone disease is clear without the need for further tests. However, confirming a diagnosis can sometimes be time-consuming even for an experienced neurologist, who occasionally needs a period of observation to be sure, particularly in cases where the condition progresses slowly. Motor neurone disease can only be diagnosed if the symptoms are clearly getting worse (progressive). ","Initial testing":"Motor neurone disease is usually diagnosed by a neurologist based on the symptoms and a physical examination. There's no single test for motor neurone disease, but the diagnosis is often obvious from a person\u2019s symptoms and physical examination by a neurologist. Various tests may be used to rule out other possible causes of the person's symptoms if they seem likely. Tests may include: blood tests \u2013 these can be used for several reasons, such as checking that certain organs, such as your thyroid, are working normally, or to look for a marker of muscle weakness (creatinine kinase) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 to give a detailed image of the inside of your brain and spinal cord electromyography (EMG) \u2013 measures the electrical activity in your muscles, which shows how well your motor neurones are working and connecting to the muscles nerve conduction test \u2013 similar to an EMG but measures how quickly your nerves can conduct an electrical signal lumbar puncture \u2013 a sample of spinal fluid may be removed for testing to exclude an inflammatory nerve condition  muscle biopsy \u2013 in rare cases, a small sample of muscle may be removed for testing to determine whether the problem lies in the muscles or nerves ","Diagnosing motor neurone disease ":"See your GP if you experience the initial symptoms of motor neurone disease, such as a progressive, usually painless, weakness of grip. After an initial examination, they may refer you to a brain and nervous system specialist (a neurologist) for a further opinion and possibly tests. Diagnosing motor neurone disease can be difficult during the condition's initial stages because many of the early symptoms can be caused by other more common health conditions such as: a trapped nerve \u2013 wear and tear of the bones in the spine can sometimes cause nerves to become trapped and compressed under the spine peripheral neuropathy \u2013 where part of the nervous system becomes damaged by another health condition, most commonly type 2 diabetes ","URL":"/conditions/Motor-neurone-disease","Receiving the diagnosis":"Being told you have motor neurone disease can be emotionally devastating and the news can be difficult to take in at first. Many people diagnosed with the condition go through the classic stages of the grieving process. These are: denial \u2013 you may initially disbelieve the diagnosis and think there's nothing wrong with you or that your doctor has missed another diagnosis anger \u2013 you may feel angry towards friends, family or medical staff, particularly if you feel that the diagnosis has been unduly delayed bargaining \u2013 people with terminal conditions sometimes try to \"bargain\" with their doctors, asking for any sort of treatment that can prolong their life depression \u2013 you may lose interest in life and feel that your situation is hopeless acceptance \u2013 you come to terms with the diagnosis, the feelings of depression pass, and you begin to plan the rest of your life If you've been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, talking to a counsellor or a trained clinical psychologist may help combat feelings of depression and anxiety. It's not unusual to have thoughts of taking your own life, although very few people with motor neurone disease go on to do this. You shouldn't be concerned about discussing any such thoughts with your doctor.  Taking antidepressants or medicines to reduce anxiety may also help as you move through the stages of the grieving process. Your care team will be able to advise you about this. Page last reviewed: 07/01/2015 Next review due: 01/01/2018 "},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms of motor neurone disease ":"The initial symptoms of motor neurone disease often affect certain areas of the body before eventually becoming more widespread. It's important to visit your GP as soon as possible if you have the typical early symptoms of motor neurone disease. There's evidence that specialist care can improve overall survival. The symptoms usually follow a pattern that falls into three stages: the initial stage the advanced stage the end stage ","Advanced symptoms":"As motor neurone disease becomes more advanced, the differences between the various types of disease are less noticeable as more parts and functions of the body are affected. The rate at which the condition spreads varies, but generally remains the same for an individual (that is, it doesn't speed up, but doesn't slow down either). The limbs become gradually weaker and the muscles in the limbs may appear progressively wasted. As a result, the person will find it increasingly difficult to move the affected limbs. The muscles may also become stiff. This is known as spasticity. Both muscle wasting and stiffness can also cause joint aches and pains. At least two-thirds of people with motor neurone disease find that speaking and swallowing become increasingly difficult as the condition progresses. However, although choking episodes can be distressing they aren't the cause of death. Reduced swallowing can cause an excess of saliva, sometimes with drooling. Thicker saliva may sometimes be difficult to clear from the chest or throat due to weakening of the muscles that control coughing. Some people with motor neurone disease have episodes of uncontrollable, excessive yawning, even when they're not tired. This can sometimes cause jaw pain. Motor neurone disease can lead to changes in a person's ability to control their emotions, particularly when there's weakness in the muscles that control speech and swallowing. One of the most common signs is when a person has episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or, more rarely, laughter. Doctors may call this emotional lability or emotionality. Occasionally, people with motor neurone disease may have significant difficulties with concentration, planning and use of language. This is known as cognitive change and overlaps with a condition called frontotemporal dementia. The changes are usually quite subtle, making it difficult to tell them apart from the normal ageing process, and they don't normally affect a person's capacity to make their own decisions. Up to 15% of people with motor neurone disease develop more profound frontotemporal dementia, usually soon after, or sometimes before, their first muscle-related symptoms. The affected person may not be aware that there are problems with their behaviour or personality. As the nerves and muscles that help control the lungs become progressively more damaged, the person's breathing will become less efficient. This may be a feeling of being very short of breath after doing everyday tasks, such as walking up the stairs. However, over time, the person may even become short of breath when they're resting. Shortness of breath may be particularly troublesome at night. Some people find it difficult to breathe when they're lying down. Others may wake up in the night because of breathlessness. As motor neurone disease progresses, a non-invasive breathing mask may be recommended at night to improve sleep quality and help reduce drowsiness during the day. ","Initial symptoms":"The initial symptoms of motor neurone disease usually develop slowly and subtly over time. It can be easy to mistake early symptoms for those of several unrelated conditions that affect the nervous system. In about two-thirds of people with motor neurone disease, the first symptoms occur in the arm or leg. This is sometimes called limb-onset disease. These symptoms include: a weakened grip, which can cause difficulties picking up or holding objects weakness at the shoulder, making lifting the arm above the head difficult tripping up over a foot because of weakness at the ankle or hip These symptoms are usually painless and may be accompanied by widespread twitching of the muscles (fasciculations) or muscle cramps, and there may be visible wasting of the muscles with significant weight loss. In a quarter of cases, problems initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing. Increasingly slurred speech (dysarthria) is usually the first sign of this type of motor neurone disease, and may be misdiagnosed as a stroke. As the condition progresses, it may become increasingly difficult to swallow (dysphagia), and be misdiagnosed as a blockage in the throat. In extremely rare cases, motor neurone disease starts by affecting the lungs, rather than affecting them at the end of the condition. This is called respiratory-onset disease. In some cases the initial symptoms are obvious, such as breathing difficulties and shortness of breath. In other cases the symptoms are less noticeable, such as waking up frequently during the night because the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen when lying down. This can make the person feel very tired and unrefreshed the next morning, sometimes with a headache. ","Secondary symptoms":"Some people with motor neurone disease have additional symptoms that aren't directly caused by the condition but are related to the stress of living with it. These may include depression, insomnia and anxiety. Although many people with motor neuron disease may think about ending their life at some point, this isn't a common outcome, particularly with strong family and community support. Page last reviewed: 07/01/2015 Next review due: 01/01/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Motor-neurone-disease","End-stage symptoms":"As motor neurone disease progresses to its final phase, a person with the condition will probably experience: increasing body paralysis, which means they'll need help with most daily activities significant shortness of breath Eventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won't be enough to compensate for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, most people with motor neurone disease become increasingly drowsy before falling into a deep sleep, where they usually die peacefully. "}},"Appendicitis":{"Treatment":{"Risks":"Appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare. However, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include: wound infection \u2013 although antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) \u2013 this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your GP if you're concerned scarring \u2013 both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made a collection of pus (abscess) \u2013 in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery hernia \u2013 at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach The use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to pneumonia. However, serious complications like this are very rare. ","Treating appendicitis ":"If you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy. Surgery is usually also recommended if there's a chance you have appendicitis but it's not been possible to make a clear diagnosis. This is because it's considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting. In humans, the appendix doesn't perform any important function and having it removed doesn't cause any long-term problems. ","Recovery":"One of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation. If the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery \u2013 for example, if you have peritonitis \u2013 it may take up to a week before you're well enough to go home. For the first few days after the operation you're likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary. If you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation. You may also experience some short-term constipation. You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome. Before leaving hospital, you'll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid. In most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for four to six weeks after open surgery. While you recover, it's important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems. Contact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice: increasing pain and swelling you start vomiting repeatedly a high temperature (fever) any discharge coming from the wound the wound is hot to touch These symptoms could be a sign of infection. ","URL":"/conditions/Appendicitis","The procedure":"Appendectomies are carried out under general anaesthetic using either a keyhole or open technique. Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery. This operation involves making three or four small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including: a tube that gas is pumped through to inflate your abdomen \u2013 this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work a laparoscope \u2013 a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor small surgical tools used to remove the appendix Once the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable stitches. Regular stitches may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later. In some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn't recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include: when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass when the surgeon isn't very experienced in laparoscopic removal people who have previously had open abdominal surgery In these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix. When there's widespread peritonitis \u2013 infection of the inner lining of the abdomen \u2013 it's sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy. As with keyhole surgery, the incision is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches that need to be removed at a later date.  After both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it's rare for a serious problem to be found. ","Alternatives to emergency surgery":"In some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass. This lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself. If an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it's not necessary to operate immediately. Instead, you'll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled. Another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis. However, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn't enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.

The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5-10cm (2-4 inches) long. It's connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed. Nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn't harmful. Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhoea. Read more about the symptoms of appendicitis. ","How appendicitis is treated":"In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible. Removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent. The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted. Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.

Most cases are thought to occur when something blocks the entrance of the appendix. For example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of faeces or an upper respiratory tract infection could lead to a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel. This obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.

This is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body's attempt to fight the infection.  It can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases. Abscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess. This can be carried out under ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) guidance using local anaesthetic and a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the placement of a drain.

Less than 1,200 people are diagnosed with cancer of the anus each year in the UK. ","What causes anal cancer?":"The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) \u2013 a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body having anal sex or lots of sexual partners \u2013 possibly because this increases your risk of developing HPV having a history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancer smoking having a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, if you have HIV Your risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men. ","Outlook":"The outlook for anal cancer depends on how advanced the condition is when it's diagnosed. The earlier it's diagnosed, the better the outlook. Compared with many other types of cancer, the outlook for anal cancer is generally better because treatment is often very effective. Around 66 out of 100 people (66%) with anal cancer will live at least five years after diagnosis, and many will live much longer than this. There are about 300 deaths from anal cancer each year in the UK. ","Symptoms of anal cancer":"The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles (haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores). Symptoms of anal cancer can include: bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding) itching and pain around the anus small lumps around the anus a discharge of mucus from the anus loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence) However, some people with anal cancer don't have any symptoms.  See your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it's best to get them checked out. ","Diagnosing anal cancer":"Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its 2015 guidelines that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within two weeks. If you're referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions. Some of the tests you may have include a: sigmoidoscopy \u2013 where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities proctoscopy \u2013 where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end biopsy \u2013 where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope  If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to \"stage\" the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread. You can read more about the stages of anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. ","How anal cancer is treated":"If you're diagnosed with anal cancer, you'll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care. The main treatments used for anal cancer are: chemoradiation \u2013 a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy surgery \u2013 to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel In cases where the cancer has spread and can't be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as palliative care. The main treatments are described in more detail below. Chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancer cells). It's currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don't usually need to stay in hospital when you're having chemoradiation. Chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in two cycles, each lasting four to five days, with a four-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your treatment has finished. The tube means you don't need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you'll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you. A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC. Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out. Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for five to six weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required. Read more about how radiotherapy is carried out. Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including: tiredness sore skin around the anus sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women hair loss \u2013 limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area feeling sick diarrhoea These side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. If you're concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins.  Other possible long-term side effects can include: bowel control problems long-term (chronic) diarrhoea erectile dysfunction vaginal pain when having sex dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder Tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated. Surgery is a less common treatment option for anal cancer. It's usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation hasn't worked. If the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under general anaesthetic, that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days. If chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic. An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery. During the operation, a permanent colostomy will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation. Before and after the operation, you'll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time. Read more about living with a colostomy. After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning. To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll gradually become less frequent over time. ","Screening for anal cancer":"There isn't a screening programme in England for anal cancer. This is because there isn't currently enough evidence to show the benefits of offering screening would outweigh the risks. You can read more about screening for anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.

The main treatment options include: antibiotics  a drainage procedure surgery Some small skin abscesses may drain naturally and get better without the need for treatment. Applying heat in the form of a warm compress, such as a warm flannel, may help reduce any swelling and speed up healing. However, the flannel should be thoroughly washed afterwards and not used by other people, to avoid spreading the infection. For larger or persistent skin abscesses, your GP may prescribe a course of antibiotics to help clear the infection and prevent it from spreading. Sometimes, especially with recurrent infections, you may need to wash off all the bacteria from your body to prevent re-infection (decolonisation). This can be done using antiseptic soap for most of your body and an antibiotic cream for the inside of your nose. However, antibiotics alone may not be enough to clear a skin abscess, and the pus may need to be drained to clear the infection. If a skin abscess isn't drained, it may continue to grow and fill with pus until it bursts, which can be very painful and can cause the infection to spread or recur. ","Incision and drainage":"If your skin abscess needs draining, you'll probably have a small operation carried out under anaesthetic \u2013 usually a local anaesthetic, where you remain awake and the area around the abscess is numbed. During the procedure, the surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the abscess, to allow the pus to drain out. They may also take a sample of pus for testing. Once all of the pus has been removed, the surgeon will clean the hole that is left by the abscess using sterile saline (a salt solution). The abscess will be left open but covered with a wound dressing, so if any more pus is produced it can drain away easily. If the abscess is deep, an antiseptic dressing (gauze wick) may be placed inside the wound to keep it open. The procedure may leave a small scar. The pus usually needs to be drained from an internal abscess, either by using a needle inserted through the skin (percutaneous abscess drainage) or with surgery. The method used will depend on the size of your abscess and where it is in your body. Antibiotics will usually be given at the same time, to help kill the infection and prevent it spreading. These may be given as tablets or directly into a vein (intravenously).  ","Percutaneous drainage":"If the internal abscess is small, your surgeon may be able to drain it using a fine needle. Depending on the location of the abscess, this may be carried out using either a local or general anaesthetic. The surgeon may use ultrasound scans or computerised tomography (CT) scans to help guide the needle into the right place. Once the abscess has been located, the surgeon drains the pus using the needle. They may make a small incision in your skin over the abscess, then insert a thin plastic tube called a drainage catheter into it. The catheter allows the pus to drain out into a bag and may have to be left in place for up to a week. This procedure may be carried out as a day case procedure, which means you'll be able to go home the same day, although some people will need to stay in hospital for a few days. As with the incision and drainage procedure for skin abscesses, percutaneous drainage may leave a small scar. ","Surgery":"You may need to undergo surgery if: your internal abscess is too large to be drained with a needle a needle can't get to the abscess safely needle drainage hasn't been effective in removing all of the pus The type of surgery you have will depend on the type of internal abscess you have and where it is in your body. Generally, it involves making a larger incision in your skin to allow the pus to be washed out.

Abscesses can develop anywhere in the body. This article focuses on two types of abscess: skin abscesses \u2013 which develop under the skin internal abscesses \u2013 which develop inside the body, in an organ or in the spaces between organs This topic covers: Symptoms When to see your GP Causes Treatment Prevention Other types of abscess A skin abscess often appears as a swollen, pus-filled lump under the surface of the skin. You may also have other symptoms of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) and chills.  It's more difficult to identify an abscess inside the body, but signs include: pain in the affected area a high temperature generally feeling unwell Read more about the symptoms of an abscess. See your GP if you think you may have an abscess. They can examine a skin abscess or refer you to hospital if you may have an internal abscess. There are several tests available to help diagnose an abscess, depending on where it's located. Read about diagnosing an abscess. Most abscesses are caused by a bacterial infection. When bacteria enter your body, your immune system sends infection-fighting white blood cells to the affected area. As the white blood cells attack the bacteria, some nearby tissue dies, creating a hole which then fills with pus to form an abscess. The pus contains a mixture of dead tissue, white blood cells and bacteria. Internal abscesses often develop as a complication of an existing condition, such as an infection elsewhere in your body. For example, if your appendix bursts as a result of appendicitis, bacteria can spread inside your tummy (abdomen) and cause an abscess to form. Read about the causes of abscesses. A small skin abscess may drain naturally, or simply shrink, dry up and disappear without any treatment. However, larger abscesses may need to be treated with antibiotics to clear the infection, and the pus may need to be drained. This will usually be done either by inserting a needle through your skin or by making a small incision in the skin over the abscess. Read more about treating an abscess. Most skin abscesses are caused by bacteria getting into a minor wound, the root of a hair or a blocked oil or sweat gland. Ensuring that your skin is clean, healthy and largely free of bacteria can help reduce the risk of skin abscesses developing. You can reduce the risk of bacteria spreading by: washing your hands regularly encouraging people in your family to wash their hands regularly using separate towels and not sharing baths waiting until your skin abscess is fully treated and healed before using any communal equipment, such as gym equipment, saunas or swimming pools Don't squeeze the pus out of the abscess yourself, because this can easily spread the bacteria to other areas of your skin. If you use tissues to wipe any pus away from your abscess, dispose of them straight away to avoid germs spreading. Wash your hands after you've disposed of the tissues. Take care when shaving your face, legs, underarm areas or bikini area to avoid nicking your skin. Clean any wounds immediately and visit your GP or local NHS walk-in centre if you think there may be something trapped in your skin. Don't share razors or toothbrushes. Read more about looking after your skin. It may also help to reduce your risk of skin abscesses by: maintaining a healthy, balanced diet  losing weight if you're overweight or obese stopping smoking It's difficult to prevent internal abscesses, as they're often complications of other conditions. There are many other types of abscess not fully covered here, including: an anorectal abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus in the rectum and anus a Bartholin's abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus inside one of the Bartholin's glands, which are found on each side of the opening of the vagina a brain abscess \u2013 a rare but potentially life-threatening build-up of pus inside the skull a dental abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus under a tooth or in the supporting gum and bone a quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) \u2013 a build-up of pus between one of your tonsils and the wall of your throat a pilonidal abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus in the skin of the cleft of the buttocks (where the buttocks separate) a spinal cord abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus around the spinal cord Page last reviewed: 19/07/2016 Next review due: 19/07/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Abscess"},"Causes":{" ":"Most abscesses are caused by an infection with staphylococcal bacteria. When bacteria enter the body, the immune system sends white blood cells to fight the infection. This causes swelling (inflammation) at the site of infection and the death of nearby tissue. A cavity is created, which fills with pus to form an abscess. The pus contains a mixture of dead tissue, white blood cells and bacteria. The abscess may get larger and more painful as the infection continues and more pus is produced. Some types of staphylococcal bacteria produce a toxin called Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) which kills white blood cells. This causes the body to make more cells to keep fighting the infection, and can lead to repeated skin infections. In rare cases, an abscess may be caused by a virus, fungi or parasites. When bacteria gets under the surface of your skin, an abscess can form. This can occur anywhere on the body, although skin abscesses tend to be more common in the: underarms hands and feet trunk genitals buttocks Bacteria can get into your skin and cause an abscess if you have a minor skin wound, such as a small cut or graze, or if a sebaceous gland (oil gland) or sweat gland in your skin becomes blocked. Abscesses that develop inside the tummy (abdomen) are caused by an infection reaching tissue deeper within the body. This can occur as a result of: an injury abdominal surgery an infection spreading from a nearby area There are many ways an infection can spread into the abdomen and cause an abscess to develop. For example, a lung abscess can form after a bacterial infection in your lungs, such as pneumonia, and a burst appendix can spread bacteria within your abdomen. In addition to the specific causes mentioned above, things that increase the likelihood of an abscess developing can include: having a weakened immune system \u2013 this could be because of a medical condition such as HIV, or a treatment such as chemotherapy having diabetes having an underlying inflammatory condition, such as hidradenitis suppurativa being a carrier of staphylococcal bacteria However, many abscesses develop in people who are otherwise generally healthy.

There are several tests used to diagnose an abscess, depending on where it's located. If you have a skin abscess, your GP will first examine the affected area and ask you: how long you've had the abscess whether you've injured that area whether you have any other symptoms A sample of pus may be taken from your abscess and sent for testing. This allows the specific bacteria causing the abscess to be identified, which can help determine the best way of treating it.  If you've had more than one skin abscess, you may be asked to give a urine sample. This will be tested for glucose, which is a sign of diabetes. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing skin abscesses. If you have recurring boils and abscesses, your GP may ask the laboratory to test the bacteria further to see if it's producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin. Additional treatments may be recommended, such as a body wash or an antibiotic cream, to stop these bacteria living on the body. Abscesses that develop inside your body are more difficult to diagnose than skin abscesses because they can't be seen. Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and any other health conditions you may have. If necessary, they'll refer you to a specialist in hospital.

Abscesses that develop inside an organ or in the spaces between organs can be more difficult to identify than skin abscesses. The symptoms can be vague and there may be no obvious external signs of a problem. The symptoms of an internal abscess can also vary depending on exactly where in the body the abscess develops. For example, a liver abscess may cause jaundice, whereas an abscess in or near the lungs may cause a cough or shortness of breath. General symptoms of an internal abscess can include: discomfort in the area of the abscess fever increased sweating feeling sick vomiting chills pain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen) loss of appetite and weight loss extreme tiredness (fatigue) diarrhoea or constipation Page last reviewed: 19/07/2016 Next review due: 19/07/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Abscess"}},"Agranulocytosis (white blood cell deficiency)":{"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that help fight infection. 'Agranulocytosis' and 'neutropenia' are terms often used to describe a deficiency of these cells. However, the two terms shouldn't be used interchangeably, as they describe slightly different conditions. agranulocytosis is the term used when the bone marrow (soft tissue inside bone) fails to make enough granulocytes neutropenia is the term used when the bone marrow fails to make enough of a specific group of granulocytes called neutrophils Although these conditions are slightly different, they tend to share many similar causes and symptoms, and are often treated in a similar way. ","What causes agranulocytosis and neutropenia?":"Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually occur later in life, as the result of another condition or treatment (acquired), but can sometimes be present from birth (congenital). Depending on the cause, your white blood cell count may recover over time. However, in some cases, the problem can be persistent. Common causes of acquired agranulocytosis or neutropenia include: chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant (or preparation for a bone marrow transplant) certain medications \u2013 including some anti-psychotics and some medications for an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) an autoimmune disorder (where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues) \u2013 such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis a bone marrow disease \u2013 such as myelodysplasia (where blood cells do not develop properly) or leukaemia certain infections \u2013 including HIV and hepatitis Congenital agranulocytosis or neutropenia can be caused by several rare genetic faults (altered genes) that may be passed on to a child by one or both of his or her parents. Individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent often have a naturally slightly lower neutrophil count than those of other ethnic origins, but this is entirely normal and does not lead to any health problems. ","Diagnosing and managing agranulocytosis and neutropenia":"If your doctor suspects you have agranulocytosis or neutropenia, they will carry out a blood test to check the level of white blood cells in your blood. If one of these conditions is diagnosed, the treatment and advice offered to you will depend on the cause and severity of your condition. You will often be given some advice about ways you can reduce your risk of infection while your white blood cell count is low. This may include: avoiding undercooked and some raw foods that could lead to food poisoning avoiding close contact with people you know have an infection making sure you store and prepare food properly maintaining good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands with soap and warm water regularly Read more about food safety and preventing germs from spreading. If you develop an infection, you will usually need to be treated with antibiotics because your body will not be able to fight the infection itself. Depending on the severity of the infection, you may be given antibiotic tablets to take at home, or you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously) while in hospital. In some cases, you may be given a course of low-dose antibiotics to take to stop infections developing in the first place. Some people may need injections of a medication called G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), which can stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. In very rare cases, you may need to go to hospital to have a type of blood transfusion where you are just given granulocyte cells. Granulocytes for transfusion are ideally taken from a donor who is a friend or relative. The donor is given corticosteroid medication plus G-CSF, which helps them to produce more granulocytes and increases the number of these in their blood. The donor's blood is then removed and the white cells are separated out for transfusion. The transfusion is usually given through a tiny plastic tube called a cannula, which is inserted into a vein in your arm. In particularly severe cases, you may need a bone marrow transplant (stem cell transplant) to replace your damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells taken from a donor. White blood cells play a key role in fighting infection  Find out about chemotherapy, a cancer treatment where medication is used to kill cancerous cells Page last reviewed: 24/09/2014 Next review due: 24/07/2017 ","Seeking medical advice":"Most people at risk of agranulocytosis or neutropenia should already be aware of signs to look out for, and will have been told what to do if they experience them. For example, if you have been having chemotherapy, your cancer care team may have given you a telephone number you can call if you experience any problems, such as a high temperature. If you know you are at risk of these white blood cell deficiencies and you start to feel unwell, it's important to contact your doctor or care team immediately. Sepsis is a medical emergency and should be assessed by a doctor in hospital as soon as possible so appropriate treatment can be started quickly. ","URL":"/conditions/agranulocytosis","Signs and symptoms":"Most people with agranulocytosis or neutropenia will not have any obvious symptoms. However, these conditions may mean you are more vulnerable to picking up infections because you don't have enough white blood cells to fight germs effectively. Symptoms associated with an infection can include: a high temperature (fever) chills and shivering headaches sweating facial flushing a sore throat or mouth mouth ulcers swollen glands a lack of energy flu-like symptoms In some people, infections can spread quickly through the body and can lead to a life-threatening condition called sepsis. In addition to some of the above symptoms, sepsis can also cause a fast heartbeat and fast breathing. "},"Title":"Agranulocytosis and neutropenia (white blood cell deficiencies) "},"Anorexia nervosa":{"Treatment":{"Treating anorexia  ":"The treatment for anorexia nervosa usually involves a combination of psychological therapy and supervised weight gain. It's important for a person with anorexia to start treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk of serious complications of anorexia, particularly if they've already lost a lot of weight. ","Gaining weight safely":"The care plan will include advice about how to increase the amount eaten so weight is gained safely. Physical health \u2013 as well as weight \u2013 is monitored closely. The height of children and young people will also be regularly checked to make sure they're developing as expected. To begin with, the person will be given small amounts of food to eat, with the amount gradually increasing as their body gets used to dealing with normal amounts. The eventual aim is to have a regular eating pattern, with three meals a day, possibly with vitamin and mineral supplements. An outpatient target is an average gain of 0.5kg (1.1lbs) a week. In a specialist unit, the aim will usually be to gain an average of around 0.5-1kg (1.1-2.2lbs) a week. See treating malnutrition for more information about what gaining weight at home or in hospital may involve. Occasionally, someone with anorexia may refuse treatment even though they're severely ill and their life is at risk. In these cases, as a last resort doctors may decide to admit the person to hospital for compulsory treatment under the Mental Health Act. This is sometimes known as sectioning or being sectioned. ","Treating additional problems":"As well as the main treatments mentioned above, other health problems caused by anorexia will also need to be treated. If you make yourself vomit regularly, you'll be given dental hygiene advice to help prevent stomach acid damaging the enamel on your teeth. For example, you may be advised not to brush your teeth soon after vomiting to avoid further abrasion to tooth enamel, and to rinse out your mouth with water instead. Avoiding acidic foods and mouth washes may be recommended. You'll also be advised to visit a dentist regularly so they can check for any problems. If you've been taking laxatives or diuretics in an attempt to lose weight, you'll be advised to reduce them gradually so your body can adjust. Stopping them suddenly can cause problems such as nausea and constipation. ","The treatment plan":"GPs are often closely involved in ongoing treatment, although other healthcare professionals are usually involved, including: specialist counsellors psychiatrists psychologists specialist nurses dietitians  paediatricians in cases affecting children and teenagers  Before treatment starts, members of this multidisciplinary care team will carry out a detailed physical, psychological and social needs assessment, and will develop a care plan. Most people with anorexia are treated as an outpatient, which means they visit hospitals, specialist centres or individual members of their care team for appointments, but return home in between. In more severe cases, a person may need to stay in hospital or a specialist centre for longer periods during the day (day patient), or they may need to be admitted as an inpatient. ","Medication":"Medication alone isn't usually effective in treating anorexia. It's often  only used in combination with the measures mentioned above to treat associated psychological problems, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression. Two of the main types of medication used to treat people with anorexia are: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013 a type of antidepressant medication that can help people with co-existing psychological problems such as depression and anxiety olanzapine \u2013 a medication that can help reduce feelings of anxiety related to issues such as weight and diet in people who haven't responded to other treatments SSRIs tend to be avoided until a person with anorexia has started to gain weight because the risk of more serious side effects is increased in people who are severely underweight. The drugs are only used cautiously in young people under the age of 18. Read more about the side effects of SSRIs. ","URL":"/conditions/Anorexia-nervosa","Psychological treatment":"A number of different psychological treatments can be used to treat anorexia. Depending on the severity of the condition, treatment will last for at least 6 to 12 months or more. Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) is based on the theory that mental health conditions such as anorexia are caused by unhealthy patterns of behaviour and thinking developed in the past, usually during childhood. CAT involves a three-stage process: reformulation \u2013 looking at past events that may explain why the unhealthy patterns developed recognition \u2013 helping people see how these patterns are contributing towards the anorexia revision \u2013 identifying changes that can break these unhealthy patterns Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the theory that how we think about a situation affects how we act and, in turn, our actions can affect how we think and feel. In terms of anorexia, the therapist will attempt to show how the condition is often associated with unhealthy and unrealistic thoughts and beliefs about food and diet. For example, these could be: \"Putting on weight is the single worst thing that can happen in my life.\" \"Everyone I know secretly thinks I'm fat.\" \"If I finish the whole meal, people I'm eating with will think I'm greedy and worthless.\" The therapist will encourage the adoption of healthier, more realistic ways of thinking that should lead to more positive behaviour. Read more about cognitive behavioural therapy. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is based on the theory that relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a powerful effect on mental health. Anorexia may be associated with feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety and self-doubt caused by problems interacting with people. During IPT, the therapist will explore negative issues associated with your interpersonal relationships and how these issues can be resolved. Focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT) is based on the theory that mental health conditions may be associated with unresolved conflicts that occurred in the past, usually during childhood. The therapy encourages people with anorexia to think about how early childhood experiences may have affected them. The aim is to find more successful ways of coping with stressful situations and negative thoughts and emotions. Anorexia doesn't just impact on one individual \u2013 it can have a big impact on the whole family. Family intervention is an important part of treatment for young people with anorexia. Family intervention should focus on the eating disorder, and involves the family discussing how anorexia has affected them. It can also help the family understand the condition and how they can help. ","Help and support":"If you have an eating disorder or know someone who does, you may find it useful to contact a support group such as Beat for information and advice. Beat provides: a confidential adult helpline on 0808 801 0677 \u2013 they also have a designated youth helpline on 0808 801 0711 (both helplines are open every day of the year from 4pm to 10pm) live chat and online support groups, where you can talk to others in a similar situation a national network of volunteer support groups You can also use the Beat HelpFinder directory to find eating disorder support services in your local area. Page last reviewed: 26/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 "},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Anorexia nervosa is a serious mental health condition. It's an eating disorder where a person keeps their body weight as low as possible. People with anorexia usually do this by restricting the amount of food they eat, making themselves vomit, and exercising excessively.  The condition often develops out of an anxiety about body shape and weight that originates from a fear of being fat or a desire to be thin. Many people with anorexia have a distorted image of themselves, thinking they're fat when they're not. Anorexia most commonly affects girls and women, although it has become more common in boys and men in recent years. On average, the condition first develops at around the age of 16 to 17. Read more about the causes of anorexia. ","Getting help":"People with anorexia often don't seek help, perhaps because they're afraid or don't recognise they have a problem. Many have hidden their condition for a long time \u2013 sometimes years. The most important first step is for someone with anorexia to realise they need help and want to get better. If you think someone you know has anorexia, try talking to them about your worries and encourage them to seek help. This can be a very difficult conversation because they may be defensive and refuse to accept they have a problem. However, it's important not to criticise or pressure them as this can make things worse. You may want to seek advice from an eating disorder support group such as Beat about the best way to raise the subject. If you think you may have anorexia, try to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by talking to a person you trust, such as a member of your family or a friend, and perhaps ask them to go with you to see your GP. Read more about supporting someone with an eating disorder and advice for parents of a child with an eating disorder. ","Treating anorexia":"Before anorexia can be treated, a physical, psychological and social needs assessment will need to be carried out by a GP or an eating disorders specialist. This will help them work out a suitable care plan. In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of psychological therapy and individually tailored advice on eating and nutrition to help gain weight safely. A range of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care, such as GPs, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and dietitians. Most people are able to be treated on an outpatient basis, which means you can go home between appointments. More serious cases are treated in hospital or specialist eating disorder clinics. Read more about diagnosing anorexia and treating anorexia. ","Outlook":"It can take several years of treatment to fully recover from anorexia, and relapses are common. For example, a woman may relapse if she tries to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Around half of people with anorexia will continue to have some level of eating problem despite treatment. If anorexia remains unsuccessfully treated for a long time, a number of other serious problems can develop. These can include fragile bones (osteoporosis), infertility, an irregular heartbeat, and other heart problems. Despite being an uncommon condition, anorexia is one of the leading causes of mental health-related deaths. This can be because of the effects of malnutrition or as a result of suicide.

Signs someone may have anorexia or another eating disorder include: missing meals, eating very little, or avoiding eating any fatty foods obsessively counting calories in food  leaving the table immediately after eating so they can vomit taking appetite suppressants, laxatives, or diuretics (a type of medication that helps remove fluid from the body) repeatedly weighing themselves or checking their body in the mirror physical problems, such as feeling lightheaded or dizzy, hair loss, or dry skin Anorexia can also be associated with other psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, alcohol misuse, and self-harm.

","URL":"/conditions/Anorexia-nervosa"},"Complications":{"Other health problems":"Long-term anorexia can lead to severe complications and health problems, often as a result of malnutrition. Some complications may improve as the condition is treated, but others can be permanent. Health problems associated with anorexia include: problems with muscles and bones \u2013 including weakness, fragile bones (osteoporosis) and problems with physical development in children and young adults sexual problems \u2013 including absent periods and infertility in women, and loss of sex drive and erectile dysfunction in men problems with the heart and blood vessels \u2013 including poor circulation, an irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, heart valve disease, heart failure and swelling in the feet, hands or face (oedema) problems with the brain and nerves \u2013 including fits (seizures) and difficulties with concentration and memory other problems \u2013 kidney damage, liver damage, anaemia and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) Some people with anorexia develop another eating disorder called bulimia nervosa. This is where a person binge eats and then immediately makes themselves sick, or uses laxatives to rid their body of the food. ","Pregnancy complications":"If you have anorexia and are pregnant, you'll need to be closely monitored during pregnancy and after you've given birth. Anorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of problems such as: miscarriage giving birth early (premature birth) having a baby with a low birth weight needing a caesarean section You're also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you previously had anorexia and recovered from it.

In some cases, the condition can even be fatal. ","URL":"/conditions/Anorexia-nervosa"},"Causes":{"Psychological factors":"Many people who develop anorexia share certain personality and behavioural traits that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include: a tendency towards depression and anxiety finding it difficult to handle stress excessive worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future perfectionism \u2013 setting strict, demanding goals or standards being very emotionally restrained having feelings of obsession and compulsion, but not necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder \u2013 unwanted thoughts, images or urges that compel them to perform certain acts It's also been suggested some people with anorexia have an overwhelming fear (phobia) of being fat. ","Causes of anorexia ":"The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors. ","Biological and genetic factors":"It's been suggested changes in brain function or hormone levels may also have a role in anorexia, although it's not clear if these lead to anorexia or if they develop later as a result of malnutrition. These changes may affect the part of the brain that controls appetite, or may lead to feelings of anxiety and guilt when eating that improve when meals are missed or after excessive exercise. The risk of someone developing anorexia is also thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders, depression, or substance misuse, which suggests genes could play a role. Page last reviewed: 26/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Environmental factors":"Puberty seems to be an important environmental factor contributing to anorexia. It may be the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem during puberty that triggers anorexia. Western culture and society may also play a part. Girls \u2013 and, to a lesser extent, boys \u2013 are exposed to a wide range of media messages that constantly reinforce the idea that being thin is beautiful. Magazines and newspapers also focus on celebrities' minor physical imperfections, such as gaining a few pounds or having cellulite. Other environmental factors that may contribute towards anorexia include: pressures and stress at school, such as exams or bullying, particularly teasing about body weight or shape occupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics a stressful life event, such as losing a job, the breakdown of a relationship, or bereavement  difficult family relationships physical or sexual abuse  Anorexia often starts off as a form of dieting that gradually gets out of control. ","URL":"/conditions/Anorexia-nervosa"},"Title":"Anorexia nervosa","Diagnosis":{"Other tests":"Your GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose anorexia nervosa, but they may check your pulse and blood pressure, take your temperature, and examine your hands and feet to see whether you have signs of any complications of anorexia. Your GP may also ask you to carry out some simple physical exercises, such as moving between sitting, squatting and standing, to assess your muscle strength. If you have anorexia, you have a higher risk of developing some heart conditions, such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Sometimes an electrocardiogram (ECG) may be needed. This is where a number of small, sticky patches (electrodes) are put on your arms, legs and chest to record the electrical signals produced by your heart. Your GP may also carry out blood tests to check your general health and the levels of chemicals or minerals such as potassium. ","Referral to a specialist":"If your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they may refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment and treatment, although they will sometimes carry out this assessment themselves. Read more about treating anorexia. Page last reviewed: 26/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Diagnosing anorexia ":"When trying to determine whether you have an eating disorder, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits. For example, they may ask: if you've lost a lot of weight recently how you feel about your weight and whether you're concerned about it if you make yourself vomit regularly whether your periods have stopped and, if so, for how long if you think you have an eating problem It's important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn't trying to judge you or catch you out \u2013 they just need to accurately assess your condition. ","Weight and BMI":"Your GP will usually check your weight. The weight of a person with anorexia nervosa is at least 15% below average for their age, sex and height. Your GP may also calculate your body mass index (BMI). For adults, a healthy BMI is 18.5 to 24.9, although sometimes doctors may be concerned if a person's BMI is below 20. Adults with anorexia generally have a BMI below 17.5. BMI isn't designed for use in those under the age of 18. Special charts known as centile charts need to be used for this group. ","URL":"/conditions/Anorexia-nervosa"},"Symptoms":{"Self-esteem, body image and feelings":"People with anorexia often believe their value as a person hinges on their weight and how they look. They may think others will like them more or they'll feel happier if they're thinner, and see their excessive weight loss in a positive way. They often have a distorted view of what they look like, thinking they look fat when they're not. Some people with anorexia may try to hide how thin they are by wearing loose or baggy clothes. Many people with the disorder also practise a type of behaviour known as \"body checking\", which involves persistently and repeatedly: weighing themselves measuring themselves, such as their waist size checking their body in the mirror People with anorexia also usually have low self-esteem or self-confidence. They may withdraw from relationships, become distant from family and friends, and lose interest in activities they previously enjoyed. Anorexia can also affect the person's school work or how well they perform their job. ","Symptoms of anorexia ":"The main symptom of anorexia is deliberately losing a lot of weight, although there are often a number of other physical and psychological signs there's a problem. ","Other signs of anorexia":"Eating too little for a long time can also cause physical symptoms, such as: bloating or constipation headaches feeling lightheaded or dizzy feeling very tired  feeling cold discoloured hands and feet caused by poor circulation dry skin hair loss from the scalp abdominal pain problems sleeping  fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body brittle nails In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected \u2013 if any \u2013 and may be smaller than others of the same age. Women and older girls with anorexia may stop having their monthly periods, known as amenorrhoea, or absent periods. Read more about the complications of anorexia nervosa. Page last reviewed: 26/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Intentional weight loss":"A person with anorexia will want to weigh as little as possible \u2013 much less than is healthy for their age and height. They're so afraid of gaining weight they can't eat normally. In an attempt to lose weight, they may: miss meals, eat very little, or avoid eating any fatty foods lie about what and when they've eaten obsessively count the calories in food  lie about how much they weigh exercise excessively take appetite suppressants, such as slimming or diet pills make themselves vomit \u2013 you may notice they leave the table immediately after meals or have dental problems such as tooth decay or bad breath caused by the acid in vomit They may also take laxatives or diuretics, a type of medication that removes fluid from the body, although in reality these have little effect on calories absorbed from food.

When you're outdoors, particularly in the summer, you could: cover exposed skin wear shoes apply insect repellent avoid wearing strong perfumes or fragrances, as these can attract insects Read more about preventing insect bites and stings. ","Pets":"It's not the pet fur that causes an allergic reaction. Instead, it's flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine. If you can't permanently remove a pet from the house, you could try:  keeping pets outside as much as possible, or limiting them to a particular area of the house, preferably an area without carpet not allowing pets in bedrooms washing pets at least once a week regularly grooming pets outside regularly washing all bedding and soft furnishings on which a pet has lain using an air filter in rooms where you spend most of your time increase ventilation with fans, air-conditioning or by opening windows If you're visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you're visiting, as this will stir up the allergens into the air. Taking an antihistamine medicine about an hour before entering a pet-inhabited house can also help reduce your symptoms. The Allergy UK website has more information about domestic pet allergies. ","Food allergies":"By law, food manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that's known to cause allergic reactions in some people. By carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction. People with food allergies most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. You can avoid this by: not relying on the menu description alone (remember, many sauces or dressings could contain allergens) communicating clearly with the waiting staff and asking for their advice avoiding places where there's a chance that different types of food could come into contact with each other, such as buffets or bakeries let restaurant staff you know your dietary requirements, including how severe your food allergy or intolerance is always check what allergens are in the dish even if you have eaten it before, as recipes and ingredients can change Remember, simple dishes are less likely to contain \"hidden\" ingredients. If you're not sure about a dish, don\u2019t risk it  Read more about living with a food allergy and advice from the Food Standards Agency on food allergen labelling. ","Mould spores":"Tiny particles released by moulds can cause an allergic reaction in some people. You can help prevent this by: keeping your home dry and well-ventilated removing any indoor pot plants from your home not drying clothes indoors, store clothes in damp cupboards or packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes dealing with any damp and condensation in your home avoiding damp buildings, damp woods and rotten leaves, cut grass and compost heaps ","House dust mites":"One of the biggest causes of allergies are dust mites, which are tiny insects found in household dust. You can limit the number of mites in your home by:  choosing wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of a carpet fitting roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean choosing leather, plastic or vinyl furniture instead of upholstered furniture cleaning cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture regularly, either by washing (at a high temperature) or vacuuming using tested allergy-proof covers on mattresses, duvets and pillows using a vacuum cleaner fitted with a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter, because it can trap more dust mites than ordinary vacuum cleaners regularly wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth \u2013 avoid dry dusting, as this can spread dust into the air Concentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend the most time, such as the bedroom and living room. You can find more information on allergies in the home on the Allergy UK website. ","Avoiding allergies ":"The best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you're allergic to, although this isn't always easy or practical. Below is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens. ","Preventing severe allergies (anaphylaxis)":"If you're at risk of experiencing a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), make sure you carry two adrenaline auto-injectors with you everywhere. Wearing a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag medallion or bracelet can make others aware of your allergy in an emergency. Consider telling your teachers, work colleagues and friends, so they can give you your adrenaline injection in an emergency, while waiting for an ambulance. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis.

Doctors often call hay fever allergic rhinitis.  Different plants pollinate at different times of the year, so the months that you get hay fever will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you are allergic to. Typically, people are affected during spring (trees) and summer (grasses). To help keep your hay fever under control, you can: check weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it's high, if possible avoid drying clothes and bedding outside when the pollen count is high wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes keep doors and windows shut when possible shower and change your clothes after being outside avoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields \u2013 particularly in the early morning, evening or night, when the pollen count is highest if you have a lawn, try asking someone else to cut the grass for you  Read more about preventing hay fever. "},"Treatment":{"Treating severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)":"Some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions, known as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. If you're at risk of this, you'll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency. If you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help. Read more about the treating anaphylaxis. ","Allergy medications":"Medications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist or GP for advice before starting any new medicine, as they're not suitable for everyone. Antihistamines are the main medicines for allergies. They can be used: as and when you notice the symptoms of an allergic reaction to prevent allergic reactions \u2013 for example, you may take them in the morning if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that day Antihistamines can be taken as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy. Decongestants can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction. They can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. Don't use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse. Red and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as: emollients (moisturising creams) to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens calamine lotion to reduce itchiness steroids to reduce inflammation (see below) Steroid medications can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction. They're available as: nasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed nose and eyes creams for eczema and contact dermatitis inhalers for asthma tablets for hives (urticaria) Sprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. Stronger creams, inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your GP. ","Immunotherapy (desensitisation) ":"Immunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above. The treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen \u2013 either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue \u2013 over the course of several years. The injection can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be taken at home. The aim of treatment is to help your body get used to the allergen so it doesn't react to it so severely. This won't necessarily cure your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication.

"},"Introduction":{"What causes allergies?":"Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful. It's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema. The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it's the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with. It's thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances. ","Introduction ":"An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance. Allergies are very common. They're thought to affect more than one in four people in the UK at some point in their lives. They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to. Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. ","Symptoms of an allergic reaction":"Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen. They can cause: sneezing a runny or blocked nose red, itchy, watery eyes wheezing and coughing a red, itchy rash worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment. Read more about the symptoms of allergies. ","How to manage an allergy":"In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible. For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling. There are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including: antihistamines \u2013 these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring decongestants \u2013 tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose lotions and creams, such as moisturising creams (emollients) \u2013 these can reduce skin redness and itchiness steroid medication \u2013 sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction For some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended. This involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn't react to it so severely.

","Is it an allergy, sensitivity or intolerance?":"allergy \u2013 a reaction produced by the body's immune system when exposed to a normally harmless substance sensitivity \u2013 the exaggeration of the normal effects of a substance; for example, the caffeine in a cup of coffee may cause extreme symptoms, such as palpitations and trembling intolerance \u2013 where a substance causes unpleasant symptoms, such as diarrhoea, but doesn't involve the immune system; people with an intolerance to certain foods can typically eat a small amount without having any problems Page last reviewed: 12/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","Common allergies":"Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include: grass and tree pollen \u2013 an allergy to these is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) dust mites animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair) food \u2013 particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow's milk insect bites and stings medication \u2013 including ibuprofen, aspirin, and certain antibiotics latex \u2013 used to make some gloves and condoms mould \u2013 these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in household chemicals \u2013 including those in detergents and hair dyes Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them. ","Getting help for allergies":"See your GP if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction can also be caused by other conditions. Your GP can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy. If your GP thinks you might have a mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. If your allergy is particularly severe or it's not clear what you're allergic to, your GP may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment. Read more about allergy testing. ","URL":"/conditions/Allergies"},"Title":"Allergies","Diagnosis":{"Challenge testing":"In a few cases, a test called a food challenge may also be used to diagnose a food allergy. During the test, you're given the food you think you're allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision. This test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop. ","Skin prick testing":"Skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests. It involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes. Skin prick testing is painless and very safe. Make sure you don't take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results. ","Blood tests":"Blood tests may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies. A sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen. ","Allergy testing kits":"The use of commercial allergy-testing kits isn't recommended. These tests are often of a lower standard than those provided by the NHS or accredited private clinics and are generally considered to be unreliable.

","Elimination diet":"If you have a suspected food allergy, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve. After a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction. Don't attempt to do this yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional. ","Allergy testing ":"If you think you have an allergy, tell your GP about the symptoms you're having, when they happen, how often they occur and if anything seems to trigger them.

"}},"Acid reflux":{"Treatment":{"Self-help":"You may find the following measures can help reduce heartburn and other symptoms of GORD: Eat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day \u2013 don't eat or drink alcohol within three or four hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening. Avoid anything you think triggers your symptoms \u2013 common triggers include coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, alcohol, and fatty or spicy food. Don't wear tight clothing \u2013 clothes that are tight around your tummy may make your symptoms worse. Raise the head of your bed by up to 20cm (8 inches) \u2013 placing a piece of wood or blocks underneath one end of your bed may reduce symptoms at night; don't just use extra pillows, as this can put a strain on your tummy. Try to relax \u2013 stress can make heartburn and GORD worse, so learning relaxation techniques may help if you're often feeling stressed. Maintain a healthy weight \u2013 if you're overweight, losing weight may help reduce your symptoms. Stop smoking \u2013 smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse. If you're taking medication for other health conditions, check with your GP to find out whether they could be contributing to your symptoms. Different medicines may be available, but don't stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your GP first. ","Medication":"A number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of GORD. Over-the-counter heartburn and GORD medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. The main types are: antacids \u2013 these neutralise the effects of stomach acid alginates \u2013 these produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists \u2013 see below for more information about these  These medicines aren't suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure. If your symptoms don't get better despite trying self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe a PPI. These work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. You'll usually be given enough medication to last a month. Go back to your GP if they don't help or your symptoms return after treatment finishes. Some people need to take PPIs on a long-term basis. The possible side effects of PPIs are usually mild. They include headaches, diarrhoea or constipation, feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain, dizziness and a rash. Your GP will prescribe the lowest dose that they think will control your symptoms to reduce the risk of side effects. If PPIs don't control your symptoms, a medicine known as a H2RA may be recommended for you to take alongside them on a short-term basis, or as an alternative. Like PPIs, H2RAs reduce the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon, but can include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a rash and tiredness. ","Surgery and procedures":"Surgery may be an option if: the above treatments don't help, aren't suitable for you, or cause troublesome side effects you don't want to take medication on a long-term basis The main procedure used is called a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). Alternative techniques have been developed more recently, although these aren't yet widely available. LNF is a type of laparoscopic or \"keyhole\" surgery. This means it's carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin. The procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus, which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. It's carried out in hospital under general anaesthetic. Most people need to stay in hospital for two or three days after the procedure. Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within three to six weeks. For the first six weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after LNF, but these should get better with time. In the last few years, several new techniques for treating GORD have been developed. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says these procedures appear to be safe, but not much is known about their long-term effects. These techniques include: Endoscopic injection of bulking agents \u2013 where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. Endoluminal gastroplication \u2013 where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open. Endoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants \u2013 where implants containing special gel are placed into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation \u2013 where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower. Laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (LINX) \u2013 where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing.

This is known as Barrett's oesophagus. It's estimated that about 1 in every 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett's oesophagus, usually after many years. Barrett's oesophagus doesn't usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those caused by GORD. However, there's a small risk that the changed cells could become cancerous in the future (see below). Your doctor may suggest having an endoscopy every few years to check for this. ","Oesophageal ulcers":"The stomach acid that leaks into the oesophagus in people with GORD can damage the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis), which can cause ulcers to form. These ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow. Medications used to treat GORD, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can help ulcers heal by reducing the amount of acid that leaks into the oesophagus. Read more about treatments for GORD.

","URL":"/conditions/Gastroesophageal-reflux-disease"},"Causes":{"Causes of GORD ":"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is usually caused by the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus (gullet) becoming weakened. Normally, this ring of muscle opens to let food into your stomach and closes to stop stomach acid leaking back up into your oesophagus. But for people with GORD, stomach acid is able to pass back up into the oesophagus. This causes symptoms of GORD, which can include heartburn and acid reflux. It's not always clear what causes this ring of muscle to become weakened, but certain things can increase the risk of it happening (see below). ","Who's most at risk of GORD?":"The following factors may increase your risk of developing GORD: being overweight or obese \u2013 this can place increased pressure on your stomach and weaken the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus eating large amounts of fatty foods \u2013 the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid after digesting a fatty meal and the resulting excess acid may leak up into the oesophagus smoking, alcohol, coffee or chocolate \u2013 these may relax the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus pregnancy \u2013 temporary changes in hormone levels and increased pressure on your stomach during pregnancy can cause GORD (read more about heartburn in pregnancy) hiatus hernia \u2013 when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle between the chest and tummy) gastroparesis \u2013 when the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid, which means excess acid can leak up into the oesophagus certain medicines \u2013 some medicines can cause GORD or make the symptoms worse, including calcium-channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), nitrates (used to treat angina) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) stress GORD can sometimes affect several members of the same family and it's been suggested that the genes you inherit from your parents may also affect your chances of developing the condition.

They may prescribe medication to treat it without needing to carry out any tests. Read more about treating GORD. ","Tests for GORD":"Tests you may have include: an endoscopy a barium swallow or barium meal test manometry 24-hour pH monitoring blood tests An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using an endoscope, which is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end. The endoscope will be gently inserted into your mouth and down your throat. The procedure is usually carried out while you're awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax. The camera can show if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn't happen to everyone with GORD. A barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus. You are first given some barium solution, then some X-rays are taken. Barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system. You'll be asked not to eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body. Manometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus. This can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and can help determine whether surgery would be suitable. During the procedure, a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. The tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus. It may be necessary to measure the acidity level (pH) in your oesophagus to confirm a diagnosis of GORD if nothing is found during an endoscopy. The acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that's passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. This is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist. You'll be asked to press a button on the recorder every time you become aware of your symptoms and to record your symptoms in a diary. You should eat as you normally would during the test to ensure an accurate result. Sometimes a blood test may be carried out to check for anaemia, which can be a sign of internal bleeding.  Page last reviewed: 02/03/2016 Next review due: 01/03/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Gastroesophageal-reflux-disease","When tests may be needed":"You'll usually only need to be referred for tests in hospital if: your GP is unsure whether you have GORD your symptoms are persistent, severe or unusual prescription medications aren't controlling your symptoms your GP thinks you might benefit from surgery you have signs of a potentially more severe condition, such as difficulty swallowing or unexplained weight loss Tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of GORD, check for other possible causes of your symptoms and determine whether you may be suitable for surgery.

"}},"Alopecia (hair loss)":{"Treatment":{"Complementary therapy":"Aromatherapy, acupuncture and massage are often used for alopecia, but there isn't enough evidence to support their use as effective treatments. ","Male-pattern baldness":"Male-pattern baldness isn't usually treated, as the treatments available are expensive and don't work for everyone. Two medicines that may be effective in treating male-pattern baldness are finasteride and minoxidil. Neither treatment is available on the NHS. You may also want to consider wearing a wig or having surgery. Finasteride is available on private prescription from your GP. It comes as a tablet you take every day. It works by preventing the hormone testosterone being converted to the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT causes the hair follicles to shrink, so blocking its production allows the hair follicles to regain their normal size. Studies have suggested finasteride can increase the number of hairs people have (hair count) and can also improve how people think their hair looks. It usually takes three to six months of continuously using finasteride before any effect is seen. The balding process usually resumes within six to 12 months if treatment is stopped. Side effects for finasteride are uncommon. Less than one in 100 men who take finasteride experience a loss of sex drive (libido) or erectile dysfunction (the inability to get or maintain an erection). Minoxidil is available as a lotion you rub on your scalp every day. It's available from pharmacies without a prescription. It's not clear how minoxidil works, but evidence suggests it can cause hair regrowth in some men. The medication contains either 5% or 2% minoxidil. Some evidence suggests the stronger version (5%) is more effective. Other evidence has shown this is no more effective than the 2% version. However, the stronger version may cause more side effects, such as dryness or itchiness in the area it's applied. Like finasteride, minoxidil usually needs to be used for several months before any effect is seen. The balding process will usually resume if treatment with minoxidil is stopped. Any new hair that regrows will fall out two months after treatment is stopped. Side effects are uncommon. ","Female-pattern baldness":"Minoxidil is currently the only medicine available to treat female-pattern baldness. Minoxidil lotion may help hair grow in around one in four women who use it, and it may slow or stop hair loss in other women. In general, women respond better to minoxidil than men. As with men, you need to use minoxidil for several months to see any effect.  ","Hair loss surgery":"Most men and women considering hair loss surgery have male-pattern or female-pattern baldness. However, surgery is sometimes suitable for a range of alopecia conditions. Surgery for hair loss should only be considered after trying less invasive treatments, and it's not usually available on the NHS.   The success of hair loss surgery depends on the skill of the surgeon, as complications can arise. It's best to speak to your GP for advice before seeking out a surgeon in the private sector. The main types of hair loss surgery are explained below. Under local anaesthetic (painkilling medication), a small piece of scalp (about 1cm wide and 30-35cm long) is removed from an area where there's plenty of hair. The piece of scalp is divided into single hairs or tiny groups of hairs, which are grafted onto areas where there's no hair. Stitches are not needed to attach the grafts because they are held in place by the clotting (thickening) action of the blood when the hairs are inserted. Fine hairs are placed at the front of the scalp and thicker hairs towards the back in a process called grading. This helps achieve a more natural result. Within six months, the hair should settle and start to regrow. Hair transplants are carried out over a number of sessions. There should be a break of nine to 12 months between procedures. As with any type of surgery, there is a risk of infection and bleeding, which can lead to hair loss and noticeable scarring. Hair transplantation isn't provided by the NHS. It can be expensive and take a long time. Scalp reduction involves removing pieces of bald scalp from the crown and the top of the head to move hairy parts of the scalp closer together. This can be done by cutting out loose skin and stitching the scalp back together, or it can be done by tissue expansion. Tissue expansion is where a balloon is placed underneath the scalp and inflated over several weeks to expand the skin in stages. The balloon is then removed and the excess skin is cut out. Scalp reductions are not suitable for hair loss at the front of the scalp because it can cause scarring. There is also the risk of infection in the area. Scalp reduction isn't usually used for male-pattern baldness, but it's available on the NHS to people with scarring alopecia. Surgery should only be carried out after any underlying conditions have cleared up. Artificial hair implantation is marketed as a treatment for male-pattern baldness. It involves implanting synthetic fibres into the scalp under local anaesthetic. The technique is not available on the NHS. Artificial hair implantation carries serious risks of infection and scarring, but clinics may be reluctant to inform people of the possible complications to avoid losing potential clients. Artificial hair implantation isn't recommended by dermatologists because of the risk of complications such as: infection scarring synthetic fibres falling out People considering hair loss surgery should explore more established treatments, such as hair transplantation and scalp reduction, because the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are better understood. The latest research into hair loss treatments is studying hair cell cloning. The technique involves taking small amounts of a person's remaining hair cells, multiplying them, and injecting them into bald areas. Cloning is intended to treat both male- and female-pattern baldness. However, the science behind the technique is new and more trials are needed before it can be fully assessed. ","Wigs":"Wigs can be a useful treatment for people with extensive hair loss.  The cheapest wigs are made from acrylic and can cost anywhere between £60 and £300. Acrylic wigs last for six to nine months. They're easier to look after than wigs made of real hair because they don't need styling. However, acrylic wigs can be itchy and hot, and need to be replaced more often than wigs made from real hair. Read about NHS wigs and fabric supports for information on who is entitled to free wigs and who can get help with costs. Some people prefer the look and feel of wigs made from real hair even though they are more expensive, costing anywhere between £200 and £2,000. Real hair wigs last for three to four years, but are harder to maintain than synthetic wigs because they may need to be set and styled by a hairdresser and professionally cleaned. A human hair wig is only available on the NHS if you're allergic to acrylic, or if you have a skin condition made worse by acrylic. You may wish to buy your wig privately. Read about NHS wigs and fabric supports for more information about how much a human hair wig costs on the NHS. Alopecia UK also has useful information about synthetic wigs and human hair wigs, including advice about choosing the right wig and how to care for it. ","Treating hair loss ":"Although hair loss rarely needs to be treated, many people seek treatment for cosmetic reasons. Many cases of hair loss are temporary, for example, due to chemotherapy, or they're a natural part of ageing and don't need treatment. However, hair loss can have an emotional impact, so you may want to look at treatment if you're uncomfortable with your appearance. If hair loss is caused by an infection or another condition, such as lichen planus or discoid lupus, treating the underlying problem may help prevent further hair loss. The various treatments for hair loss are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for hair loss, allowing you to compare your treatment options. ","URL":"/conditions/Hair-loss","Tattooing":"For many people, it's possible to replicate hair with a tattoo. This is known as dermatography and generally produces good long-term results, although it is usually expensive and can only be used to replicate very short hair. This is usually carried out for eyebrows over a few hourly sessions and can even be used as a treatment for scalp hair loss caused by male-pattern baldness. ","Alopecia areata":"There is no completely effective treatment for alopecia areata. However, in most cases the hair grows back after about a year without treatment. So \"watchful waiting\" is sometimes best, particularly if you just have a few small patches of hair loss. Some treatments for alopecia areata are outlined below. Corticosteroids are medicines containing steroids, a type of hormone. They work by suppressing the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). This is useful in alopecia areata because the condition is thought to be caused by the immune system damaging the hair follicles. Corticosteroid injections appear to be the most effective treatment for small patches of alopecia. As well as your scalp, they can also be used in other areas, such as your eyebrows. A corticosteroid solution is injected several times into the bald areas of skin. This stops your immune system from attacking the hair follicles. It can also stimulate hair to grow again in those areas after about four weeks. The injections are repeated every few weeks. Alopecia may return when the injections are stopped. Side effects of corticosteroid injections include pain at the injection site and thinning of your skin (atrophy). Topical corticosteroids (creams and ointments) are widely prescribed for treating alopecia areata, but their long-term benefits are not known. They are usually prescribed for a three-month period. Possible corticosteroids include: betamethasone  hydrocortisone mometasone These are available as a lotion, gel or foam depending on which you find easiest to use. However, they cannot be used on your face, for example on your beard or eyebrows. Possible side effects of corticosteroids include thinning of your skin and acne. Corticosteroids tablets aren't recommended because of the risk of serious side effects. Minoxidil lotion is applied to the scalp and can stimulate hair regrowth after about 12 weeks. However, it can take up to a year for the medication to take full effect. Minoxidil is licensed to treat both male- and female-pattern baldness, but is not specifically licensed to treat alopecia areata. This means it hasn't undergone thorough medical testing for this purpose. Minoxidil is not recommended for those under 18 years old. It's not available on the NHS, but can be prescribed privately or bought over the counter. Immunotherapy may be an effective form of treatment for extensive or total hair loss, although fewer than half of those who are treated will see worthwhile hair regrowth. A chemical solution called diphencyprone (DPCP) is applied to a small area of bald skin. This is repeated every week using a stronger dose of DPCP each time. The solution eventually causes an allergic reaction and the skin develops mild eczema (dermatitis). In some cases, this results in hair regrowth after about 12 weeks. A possible side effect of immunotherapy is a severe skin reaction. This can be avoided by increasing the DPCP concentration gradually. Less common side effects include a rash and patchy-coloured skin (vitiligo). In many cases, the hair falls out again when treatment is stopped. Immunotherapy is only available in specialised centres. You'll need to visit the centre once a week for several months. After DPCP has been applied, you'll need to wear a hat or scarf over the treated area for 24 hours because light can interact with the chemical. Similar to immunotherapy, dithranol cream is applied regularly to the scalp before being washed off. It causes a skin reaction, followed by hair regrowth in some cases. However, it hasn't been proven that dithranol cream is significantly effective in the long term. It can also cause itchiness and scaling of the skin and can stain the scalp and hair. For these reasons, dithranol is not widely used. Two to three sessions of light therapy (phototherapy) are given every week in hospital. The skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UVA or UVB) rays. In some cases, before your skin is exposed to UV light you may be given a medicine called psoralen, which makes your skin more sensitive to the light. The results of light therapy are often poor. The treatment can take up to a year to produce maximum results and responses vary, with a high relapse rate. It's often not a recommended treatment because side effects can include: nausea (feeling sick) pigment changes to the skin an increased risk of skin cancer  ","Emotional support":"If you need emotional support following hair loss, you can contact the charity Alopecia UK. An online forum is available where you can talk to other people with alopecia, and a network of support groups exists across the country. Page last reviewed: 07/01/2015 Next review due: 01/01/2018 "},"Introduction":{"Scarring alopecia ":"Scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia, is usually caused by complications of another condition. In this type of alopecia, the hair follicle (the small hole in your skin that an individual hair grows out of) is completely destroyed. This means your hair won't grow back. Depending on the condition, the skin where the hair has fallen out is likely to be affected in some way. Conditions which can cause scarring alopecia include: scleroderma \u2013 a condition affecting the body's connective (supporting) tissues, resulting in hard, puffy and itchy skin lichen planus \u2013 an itchy rash affecting many areas of the body discoid lupus \u2013 a mild form of lupus affecting the skin, causing scaly marks and hair loss folliculitis decalvans \u2013 a rare form of alopecia that most commonly affects men, causing baldness and scarring of the affected areas frontal fibrosing alopecia \u2013 a type of alopecia that affects post-menopausal women where the hair follicles are damaged, and the hair falls out and is unable to grow back Scarring alopecia occurs in both males and females, but is less common in children than adults. It accounts for about 7% of hair loss cases. ","Introduction ":"Alopecia is the general medical term for hair loss. There are many types of hair loss with different symptoms and causes. Some of the more common types of hair loss are described below, including: male- and female-pattern baldness  alopecia areata scarring alopecia anagen effluvium telogen effluvium ","Male- and female-pattern baldness":"Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age. It usually starts around the late twenties or early thirties and most men have some degree of hair loss by their late thirties. It generally follows a pattern of a receding hairline, followed by thinning of the hair on the crown and temples, leaving a horseshoe shape around the back and sides of the head. Sometimes it can progress to complete baldness, although this is uncommon. Male-pattern baldness is hereditary, which means it runs in families. It's thought to be caused by oversensitive hair follicles, linked to having too much of a certain male hormone. As well as affecting men, it can sometimes affect women (female-pattern baldness). During female-pattern baldness, hair usually only thins on top of the head. It's not clear if female-pattern baldness is hereditary and the causes are less well understood. However, it tends to be more noticeable in women who have been through the menopause (when a woman's periods stop at around age 52), perhaps because they have fewer female hormones. ","Emotional issues":"Hair loss can be difficult to come to terms with. The hair on your head can be a defining part of your identity. If you start to lose your hair, it can feel as if you're losing part of your identity. This can affect your self-confidence and sometimes lead to depression. Speak to your GP if you're finding it difficult to deal with your hair loss. They may suggest counselling. You may also benefit from joining a support group or speaking to other people in the same situation \u2013 for example, through online forums. A number of charities, such as Alopecia UK, have support groups and online forums where you can talk to others who are experiencing hair loss. Page last reviewed: 07/01/2015 Next review due: 01/01/2018 ","Anagen effluvium":"Anagen effluvium is widespread hair loss that can affect your scalp, face and body. One of the most common causes of this type of hair loss is the cancer treatment chemotherapy. In some cases, other cancer treatments \u2013 including immunotherapy and radiotherapy \u2013 may also cause hair loss. The hair loss is usually noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, not all chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss and sometimes the hair loss is so small it's hardly noticeable. It may be possible to reduce hair loss from chemotherapy by wearing a special cap that keeps the scalp cool. However, scalp cooling is not always effective and not widely available. In most cases, hair loss in anagen effluvium is temporary. Your hair should start to grow back a few months after chemotherapy has stopped. ","Telogen effluvium":"Telogen effluvium is a common type of alopecia where there is widespread thinning of the hair, rather than specific bald patches. Your hair may feel thinner, but you're unlikely to lose it all and your other body hair isn't usually affected. Telogen effluvium can be caused by your body reacting to: hormonal changes, such as those that take place when a woman is pregnant intense emotional stress intense physical stress, such as childbirth a short-term illness, such as a severe infection or an operation a long-term illness, such as cancer or liver disease changes in your diet, such as crash dieting some medications, such as anticoagulants (medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot) or beta-blockers (used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure) In most cases of telogen effluvium, your hair will stop falling out and start to grow back within six months. ","How is hair loss treated?":"More common types of hair loss, such as male-pattern baldness, don't need treatment because they're a natural part of ageing and don't pose a risk to your health. However, any type of hair loss can be distressing, so you should see your GP if you're worried about it. Your GP should be able to diagnose your type of hair loss by examining your hair. They can also discuss possible treatments with you so it's advisable to visit your GP before trying a private consultant dermatologist (skin care specialist). If you want treatment for male-pattern baldness for cosmetic reasons, two medications called finasteride and minoxidil can be used. Minoxidil can also be used to treat female-pattern baldness. However, these treatments don't work for everyone and only work for as long as they're continued. They are not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Alopecia areata is usually treated with steroid injections, although it's sometimes possible to use a steroid cream, gel or ointment. A treatment called immunotherapy may also be used. This involves stimulating hair growth by causing an intentional allergic reaction in the affected areas of skin. If you have significant hair loss of any type, you may decide to wear a wig. Wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for help with charges. There are also some surgical options for hair loss, including a hair transplant and artificial hair implants. Read more about treating hair loss. ","URL":"/conditions/Hair-loss","Alopecia areata":"Alopecia areata causes patches of baldness about the size of a large coin. They usually appear on the scalp but can occur anywhere on the body. It can occur at any age, but mostly affects teenagers and young adults. In most cases of alopecia areata, hair will grow back in a few months. At first, hair may grow back fine and white, but over time it should thicken and regain its normal colour. Some people go on to develop a more severe form of hair loss, such as: alopecia totalis (no scalp hair) alopecia universalis (no hair on the scalp and body) Alopecia areata is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). It's more common among people with other autoimmune conditions, such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes or Down's syndrome. It's also believed some people's genes make them more susceptible to alopecia areata, as one in five people with the condition have a family history of the condition. Alopecia areata can occur at any age, although it's more common in people aged 15-29. It affects one or two people in every 1,000 in the UK. "},"Title":"Hair loss"},"Arteriosclerosis":{"Introduction":{" ":"Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances called plaques, or atheroma. These plaques cause the arteries to harden and narrow, restricting the blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs, and increasing the risk of blood clots that could potentially block the flow of blood to the heart or brain. Atherosclerosis doesn't tend to have any symptoms at first, and many people may be unaware they have it, but it can eventually cause life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes if it gets worse. However, the condition is largely preventable with a healthy lifestyle, and treatment can help reduce the risk of serious problems occurring.

There won't usually be any symptoms until CVD develops. Types of CVD include: coronary heart disease \u2013 the main arteries that supply your heart (the coronary arteries) become clogged with plaques angina \u2013 short periods of tight, dull or heavy chest pain caused by coronary heart disease, which may precede a heart attack heart attacks \u2013 where the blood supply to your heart is blocked, causing sudden crushing or indigestion-like chest pain that can radiate to nearby areas, as well as shortness of breath and dizziness strokes \u2013 where the blood supply to your brain is interrupted, causing the face to droop to one side, weakness on one side of the body, and slurred speech transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) \u2013 where there are temporary symptoms of a stroke peripheral arterial disease \u2013 where the blood supply to your legs is blocked, causing leg pain when walking Click on the links above for more information about these conditions, including what the main symptoms and risks are. Exactly why and how arteries become clogged is unclear. It can happen to anyone, although the following things can increase your risk: increasing age smoking an unhealthy, high-fat diet lack of exercise being overweight or obese regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol other conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes a family history of atherosclerosis and CVD being of south Asian, African or African-Caribbean descent You can't do anything about some of these factors, but by tackling things such as an unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise, you can help reduce your risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Read more about the risk factors for CVD. Speak to your GP if you're worried you may be at a high risk of atherosclerosis. If you're between the ages of 40 and 74, you should have an NHS Health Check every five years, which will include tests to find out if you're at risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Your GP or practice nurse can work out your level of risk by taking into account factors such as: your age, gender and ethnic group your weight and height if you smoke or have previously smoked if you have a family history of CVD your blood pressure and cholesterol levels if you have certain long-term conditions Depending on your result, you may be advised to make lifestyle changes, consider taking medication, or have further tests to check for atherosclerosis and CVD. Making healthy lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of developing atherosclerosis and may help stop it getting worse. The main ways you can reduce your risk are: stop smoking \u2013 you can call the NHS Smokefree helpline for advice on 0300 123 1044 or ask your GP about stop smoking treatments; read more advice about stopping smoking  have a healthy diet \u2013 avoid foods that are high in saturated fats, salt or sugar, and aim to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day; read more healthy diet advice exercise regularly \u2013 aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, and strength exercises on at least two days a week maintain a healthy weight \u2013 aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 24.9; use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI and read advice about losing weight moderate your alcohol consumption \u2013 men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 alcohol units a week; get tips on cutting down on alcohol Click on the links above for more information. You can also read more specific advice about preventing CVD. There aren't currently any treatments that can reverse atherosclerosis, but the healthy lifestyle changes suggested above may help stop it getting worse.

Although there's no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, early treatment and support \u2013 including lifestyle changes, medication, supportive treatments and surgery \u2013 can reduce the risk of joint damage and limit the impact of the condition. Your treatment will usually involve care from your GP in addition to a number of different specialists. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance on the management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults. ","Stopping the condition progressing hide":"There are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems. These are often divided into two types of medication: 'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)' and 'biological treatments'. If you've been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you'll normally be offered a combination of DMARD tablets as part of your initial treatment. These medications are particularly effective in easing symptoms of the condition and slowing down its progression. DMARDs work by blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage. There are many different DMARDs that can be used, including: methotrexate leflunomide hydroxychloroquine sulfasalazine Methotrexate is normally the first medicine given for rheumatoid arthritis, often alongside another DMARD and a short-course of corticosteroids to relieve any pain (see below). It may also be combined with the biological treatments mentioned below. Common side effects of methotrexate include: feeling sick loss of appetite a sore mouth diarrhoea headaches hair loss The medication can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver, so you'll have regular blood tests to monitor this. Less commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you'll usually have a chest X-ray and possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you develop shortness of breath or a persistent dry cough while taking it. However, most people tolerate methotrexate well. It can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It's important to keep taking the medication, even if you don't notice it working at first. You may have to try two or three types of DMARD before you find the one that's most suitable for you. Once you and your doctor work out the most suitable DMARD, you'll usually have to take the medicine in the long term. Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. They include: etanercept infliximab adalimumab certolizumab golimumab rituximab abatacept tocilizumab They're usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD and are normally only used if these medications alone haven't been effective. Biological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints. Side effects from biological treatments are usually mild and include: skin reactions at the site of the injections infections feeling sick a high temperature (fever) headaches Some people may also be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as tuberculosis (TB) in people who have had them in the past. ","Relieving pain show":"In addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain. Some of the different medicines that may be used to relieve pain are outlined below. In some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such as paracetamol, or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis. These medications don't help treat the underlying inflammation of your joints, but they can sometimes be helpful in relieving pain. For example, they may be recommended while you're waiting to see a specialist or during periods where your symptoms are particularly bad (flare-ups). In addition to \u2013 or instead of \u2013 the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This may be a traditional NSAID (such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib). These medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they won't stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time. Your doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them. Although uncommon, taking an NSAID tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems \u2013 such as internal bleeding \u2013 because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids. If you're prescribed an NSAID tablet, you'll often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), as well. Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining. Corticosteroids are powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation. They can be used as: a tablet (for example, prednisolone) an injection directly into a painful joint an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints) They're usually used to provide short-term pain relief \u2013 for example, while you're waiting for DMARD medication to take effect or during a flare-up. Corticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) easy bruising muscle weakness thinning of the skin ","Complementary and alternative therapies show":"Many people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies, such as: massage acupuncture osteopathy chiropractic In most cases, there's little or no evidence these are effective in the long-term, although some people may experience a short-term benefit from them. There's no strong evidence to suggest that specific dietary changes can help improve rheumatoid arthritis, although some people with rheumatoid arthritis feel their symptoms get worse after they've eaten certain foods. If you think this may be the case for you, it may be useful to try avoiding problematic foods for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. However, it's important to ensure your overall diet is still healthy and balanced. There's also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medications you may be taking. For example, calcium and vitamin D supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you're taking steroids and folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate. However, there's some evidence to suggest that taking fish oil supplements may help reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis.

A physiotherapist may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible. They may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. If rheumatoid arthritis causes you problems with everyday tasks, occupational therapy may help. An occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you're at home and at work.

In such cases, you may need surgery to help restore your ability to use your joint. Surgery may also be recommended to reduce pain or correct deformities. There are different types of surgery to correct joint problems in the hand. Examples include: carpal tunnel release (cutting a ligament in the wrist to relieve pressure on a nerve) \u2013 see treating carpal tunnel syndrome for more information release of tendons in the fingers to treat abnormal bending removal of inflamed tissue that lines the finger joints Arthroscopy is a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue. During the operation, a thin tube with a light source and camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small cut in the skin so the surgeon can see the affected joint. Special surgical instruments are inserted through other small cuts in the skin to remove the damaged tissue. You usually don't have to stay overnight in hospital for this kind of surgery, but the joint will need to be rested at home for several days. Some people with rheumatoid arthritis need surgery to replace part or all of a joint, such as the hip, knee or shoulder joint. This is known as a joint replacement or arthroplasty. Replacement of these joints is a major operation that involves several days in hospital followed by months of rehabilitation. The latest joints have a limited lifespan of 10-20 years. They're not perfect and some function may not be restored after the damaged joint is replaced by a new one.  Read about knee replacement and hip replacement. "},"Introduction":{" ":"Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. The symptoms usually affect the hands, feet and wrists. There may be periods where symptoms become worse, known as flare-ups or flares. A flare can be difficult to predict, but with treatment it's possible to decrease the number of flares and minimise or prevent long-term damage to the joints. Some people with rheumatoid arthritis also experience problems in other parts of the body, or more general symptoms such as tiredness and weight loss. Read about the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. You should see your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so they can try to identify the underlying cause. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage. Read about diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means your immune system \u2013 which usually fights infection \u2013 attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making the joints swollen, stiff and painful. Over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone.

Some of these conditions are described below. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition in people with rheumatoid arthritis. It's the result of compression of the nerve that controls sensation and movement in the hands (median nerve) and can cause symptoms such as: aching numbness tingling in your thumb, fingers and part of the hand Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can sometimes be controlled with wrist splints or corticosteroid injections, although surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve may be needed in severe cases. Read about treating carpal tunnel syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition which can cause inflammation to develop in other parts of your body, such as the: Lungs \u2013 inflammation of the lungs or lung lining can lead to pleurisy or pulmonary fibrosis, which can cause chest pain, a persistent cough and shortness of breath. Heart \u2013 inflammation of the tissue around the heart can lead to pericarditis, which causes chest pain. Eyes \u2013 inflammation of the eyes can lead to scleritis or Sjogren's syndrome. Scleritis can cause eye redness and pain, whereas Sjogren's syndrome can cause dry eyes. Blood vessels \u2013 known as vasculitis \u2013 this can lead to the thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring of blood vessel walls. In serious cases, it can affect blood flow to your body's organs and tissues and can be life-threatening. However, thanks to early treatment, inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body is becoming less common.  If rheumatoid arthritis isn't treated early or isn't well controlled, the inflammation in your joints could lead to significant and permanent damage. Problems that can affect the joints include: damage to nearby bone and cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints) damage to nearby tendons (flexible tissue that attach muscle to bone), which could cause them to break (rupture) joint deformities These problems sometimes need to be treated with surgery to prevent loss of function in the affected joints. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you're at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) than the population at large. CVD is a general term that describes conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels, and it includes life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes. It's not clear exactly why people with rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of these problems. You can reduce your risk by ensuring your arthritis is well controlled and by reducing the impact of other factors that contribute to CVD, such as: stopping smoking eating healthily exercising regularly Read about preventing CVD. If you've had rheumatoid arthritis for some time, you're at increased risk of developing cervical myelopathy and you may need a special assessment of your neck before any operation where you're put to sleep. This condition is caused by dislocation of joints at the top of the spine, which put pressure on the spinal cord. Although relatively uncommon, it's a serious condition that can greatly affect your mobility and can lead to permanent spinal cord damage if not treated promptly with surgery.

However, it's not yet known what triggers this. Your immune system normally makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping to fight infection. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint. This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed, releasing chemicals that damage nearby: bones cartilage \u2013 the stretchy connective tissue between bones tendons \u2013 the tissue that connects bone to muscle ligaments \u2013 the tissue that connects bone and cartilage If the condition isn't treated, these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment. Eventually, it can destroy the joint completely. Various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested, such as an infection or virus being a trigger, but none of these theories has been proven. There are a number of things that may increase your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including: your genes \u2013 there's some evidence that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families, although the risk of inheriting the condition is thought to be low as genes are only thought to play a small role in the condition hormones \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women than men, which may be because of the effects of the hormone oestrogen, although this link hasn't been proven smoking \u2013 some evidence suggests that people who smoke are at an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis ","Want to know more?":"National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): Possible causes and risk factors Page last reviewed: 12/08/2016 Next review due: 12/08/2019 ","URL":"/conditions/Rheumatoid-arthritis"},"Title":"Rheumatoid arthritis","Diagnosis":{" ":"Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation and there's no definitive test for the condition. You should see your GP if you have these symptoms so they can try to determine the cause. Your GP will carry out a physical examination, checking your joints for any swelling and to assess how easily they move. Your GP will also ask you about your symptoms. It's important to tell your GP about all your symptoms, not just ones you think are important, as this will help them to make the correct diagnosis. If your GP thinks you have rheumatoid arthritis, they'll refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist). Your GP may arrange blood tests to help confirm the diagnosis. No blood test can definitively prove or rule out a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but a number of tests can show possible indications of the condition. Some of the main tests used include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) C-reactive protein (CRP) full blood count Read more about blood tests. The full blood count measures your red cells to rule out anaemia. Anaemia means the blood is unable to carry enough oxygen, because of a lack of blood cells. Anaemia is common in people with rheumatoid arthritis, although having anaemia doesn't prove you have rheumatoid arthritis. Specific blood tests can help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, but aren't accurate in everyone. About half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have a positive rheumatoid factor present in their blood when the disease starts, but about one in 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also tests positive. An antibody test known as anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is available. People who test positive for anti-CCP are very likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but not everybody found to have rheumatoid arthritis has this antibody. Those who test positive for both rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP may be more likely to have severe rheumatoid arthritis requiring higher levels of treatment. A number of different scans may also be carried out to check for joint inflammation and damage. These can help tell the difference between different types of arthritis and can be used to monitor how your condition is progressing over time. Scans that may be carried out to diagnose and monitor rheumatoid arthritis include: X-rays \u2013 where radiation is passed through your body to examine your bones and joints ultrasound scans \u2013 where high frequency sound waves are used to create an image of joints magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans \u2013 where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your joints ","Want to know more?":"Arthritis Care: Getting a diagnosis National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society: Making a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society: Newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis?

You may need long-term treatment to control your symptoms and reduce joint damage. Depending on how much pain and stiffness you feel and how much joint damage you have, you may have to adapt the way you carry out simple daily tasks. They can become difficult or take longer to complete. Here are some things you can do to help keep the condition under control. Self-care is an integral part of daily life. It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from those involved in your care. Self-care includes what you do every day to stay fit and maintain good physical and mental health, prevent illness or accidents and care more effectively for minor ailments and long-term conditions. People living with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from being supported to care for themselves. They can live longer, have a better quality of life and be more active and independent. It's important to take your medication as prescribed, even if you start to feel better, as medication can help prevent flare-ups and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage. If you have any questions or concerns about the medication you are taking or side effects, talk to your healthcare team. It may also be useful to read the information leaflet that comes with the medication about possible interactions with other drugs or supplements. Check with your healthcare team before taking any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers or nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with your medication. As rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition, you'll be in contact with your healthcare team regularly so they can check to ensure your condition is under good control and your treatment is right for you. You may have your disease activity score (DAS) measured regularly, which can help your healthcare team to decide on the best treatment. Read more about the DAS score on the National Rheumatoid Arthritis website. The more the team knows, the more they can help you, so discuss any concerns you have with them. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you may be advised to have a yearly flu jab to protect against flu. You may also be advised to have a pneumococcal vaccination, a one-off injection that protects against a specific serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia. Get plenty of rest during a flare-up as this is when your joints can be particularly painful and inflamed. Putting further strain on very swollen and painful joints can often make the pain and inflammation worse. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with rheumatoid arthritis. They can help prevent many conditions, including heart disease and many forms of cancer. Exercising regularly can help relieve stress, help keep your joints mobile and strengthen the muscles supporting your joints. Exercise can also help you lose weight if you're overweight, which can put extra strain on your joints. However, it's important to strike a balance between rest and exercise. Rest will make inflamed joints feel more comfortable, but without movement your joints will stiffen and your muscles will become weaker. You need to find out the best activities and the right balance for you. When starting exercise it's always best to increase the amount of exercise you do gradually and if a particular activity causes your joints to become warm and swollen or if it causes severe pain then stop and rest. If not, you should be fine to continue. If a particular activity always causes a flare-up then it's probably best to avoid it and find an alternative. In general, exercises involving high impact such as step exercises or contact sports such as rugby and football are more likely to cause problems. Forms of exercise that put less strain on your joints include swimming, cycling, walking and aqua aerobics.  If you need further help, your physiotherapist is a good person to help advise on appropriate exercises for you. ","Starting and raising a family show":"If you're taking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, let your healthcare team know if you want to start a family or if you're worried about becoming pregnant while on medication. Some medications, such as methotrexate, leflunomide and biological treatments, shouldn't be taken by men or women while they're trying for a baby. The doctors and nurses will work with you to ensure your rheumatoid arthritis is controlled while you're trying to get pregnant. Babies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent, but particularly so if you have rheumatoid arthritis. If you're struggling to cope, it may help to talk to other people in the same situation as you. You may also be able to get additional support from your health visitor or occupational therapist to help you manage your young family. ","Money and benefits show":"If you have to stop work or work part time because of your rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially.

If you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance. If you're aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for a Personal Independence Payment. If you're aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance. If you're caring for someone with rheumatoid arthritis, you may be entitled to Carer's Allowance. You may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you're likely to need repeat prescriptions of medication to keep your condition under control. Rheumatoid arthritis isn't listed as a medical condition that entitles a person to free prescriptions in England, although you may be able to get your medication for free if your condition falls under the category of \"a continuing physical disability which means the person can't go out without the help of another person\". You're also entitled to free prescriptions if you're 60 or over, or if you receive either:  Income Support income-based Jobseeker's Allowance income-related Employment and Support Allowance.

They can come and go, and may change over time. You may occasionally experience flares when your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more severe. Rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects the joints. It can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this isn't always the case. The main symptoms affecting the joints are outlined below. ","Pain":"The joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity. ","Swelling, warmth and redness":"The lining of joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch. In some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints. As well as problems affecting the joints, some people with rheumatoid arthritis experience a range of more general symptoms, such as: tiredness and a lack of energy a high temperature (fever) sweating a poor appetite weight loss The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can also sometimes cause problems affecting other areas of the body, such as: dry eyes \u2013 if the eyes are affected chest pain \u2013 if the heart or lungs are affected Read about the complications of rheumatoid arthritis. Page last reviewed: 12/08/2016 Next review due: 12/08/2019 ","Stiffness":"Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. For example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist. Like joint pain, the stiffness is often more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis called osteoarthritis usually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often lasts longer than this.

If used in this way, they can cause serious side effects and addiction.  Anabolic steroids are manufactured drugs that mimic the effects of the male hormone testosterone. They have limited medical uses and aren't to be confused with corticosteroids, a different type of steroid drug that's commonly prescribed for a variety of conditions. This page explains the dangers of misusing anabolic steroids, and aims to advise and support those who are addicted to the drugs. It covers: anabolic steroids and the law why people misuse anabolic steroids how they are taken side effects addiction getting help ","Addiction":"Like many other substances, anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking them. A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will continue using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects. When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose. Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include: depression and apathy feelings of anxiety difficulty concentrating insomnia  anorexia  decreased sex drive extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches  muscle and joint pain ","Side effects of anabolic steroids":"Regularly taking anabolic steroids causes a range of male features, not just increased muscle mass. It can also lead to potentially dangerous medical conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart attacks. Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include: reduced sperm count infertility shrunken testicles erectile dysfunction baldness breast development increased risk of developing prostate cancer severe acne stomach pain In women, anabolic steroids can cause: facial hair growth and body hair loss of breasts swelling of the clitoris  a deepened voice an increased sex drive problems with periods hair loss severe acne In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions: heart attack or stroke liver or kidney tumours high blood pressure (hypertension)  blood clots  fluid retention high cholesterol   Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects: aggressive behaviour  mood swings manic behaviour hallucinations and delusions Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth. As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include: damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection HIV transmission ","Are anabolic steroids illegal?":"Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be sold by pharmacists with a prescription. It's not illegal to possess anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service. However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence. In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. ","Getting help ":"You should see your GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction. Your GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus strategies for dealing with those obstacles.

Some athletes, weightlifters and bodybuilders take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies. However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphia, an anxiety disorder where the way someone thinks about their body doesn't match the way it looks. Teenage boys and young men may take the drugs because they have reverse anorexia. This is when they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough. Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit. ","How anabolic steroids are taken":"Anabolic steroids are usually injected into the muscle, but some are available in tablet form, or as creams or gels that are applied to the skin. Most people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and have ways of getting the desired effect without the undesirable side effects. This involves injecting the drugs for a period of time and then stopping for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\". More than one type of anabolic steroid may be used at a time. Users believe this increases the effectiveness, and is known as \"stacking\". The term \"pyramiding\" refers to a combination of both stacking and cycling. One or more anabolic steroid is taken in a low dose. This is gradually increased to a maximum dose over 6 to 12 weeks, before the dose is reduced to zero to give the body a break and the cycle is started again. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time. Athletes have been known to try to time their injections so the drug is out of their system by the time they're drug tested.

Fine needles are inserted at certain sites in the body for therapeutic or preventative purposes. It is used in many NHS general practices, as well as the majority of pain clinics and hospices in the UK. Acupuncture is often seen as a form of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). This topic covers: How it works Uses Acupuncture on the NHS How it's performed Safety and regulation Western medical acupuncture is the use of acupuncture following a medical diagnosis. It involves stimulating sensory nerves under the skin and in the muscles of the body. This results in the body producing natural substances, such as pain-relieving endorphins. It's likely that these naturally released substances are responsible for the beneficial effects experienced with acupuncture. A course of acupuncture usually creates longer lasting pain relief than when a single treatment is used. Traditional acupuncture is based on the belief that an energy, or \"life force\", flows through the body in channels called meridians. This life force is known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\"). Practitioners who adhere to traditional beliefs about acupuncture believe that when Qi doesn't flow freely through the body, this can cause illness. They also believe acupuncture can restore the flow of Qi, and so restore health. Acupuncture practitioners \u2013 sometimes called acupuncturists \u2013 use acupuncture to treat a wide range of health conditions. However, the use of acupuncture isn't always based on rigorous scientific evidence. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for the NHS on the use of treatments and care of patients. Currently, NICE only recommends considering acupuncture as a treatment option for: chronic tension-type headaches migraines Acupuncture is also often used to treat other musculoskeletal conditions (of the bones and muscles) and pain conditions, including: chronic pain, such as neck pain joint pain dental pain postoperative pain However, in many conditions where acupuncture is used, there's less good quality evidence to draw any clear conclusions over its effectiveness compared with other treatments. Acupuncture is sometimes available on the NHS, most often from GPs or physiotherapists, although access is limited. Most acupuncture patients pay for private treatment. The cost of acupuncture varies widely between practitioners. Initial sessions usually cost £40-70, and further sessions £25-60.  If you're being treated by an acupuncture practitioner for a health condition or are considering having acupuncture, it's advisable to discuss this with your GP. An initial acupuncture session usually lasts 20-40 minutes and involves an assessment of your general health, medical history and a physical examination, followed by insertion of the acupuncture needles. Courses of treatment often involve up to 10 separate sessions, but this can vary. ","Insertion of the needles":"The needles are inserted into specific places on the body, which practitioners call acupuncture points. During the session, you'll usually be asked to sit or lie down. You may also be asked to remove some clothes so the practitioner can access certain parts of your body. The needles used are fine and are usually a few centimetres long. They should be single-use, pre-sterilised needles that are disposed of immediately after use.  Acupuncture practitioners choose specific points to place the needles based on your condition. Up to 12 points may be used during a typical session, sometimes more depending on the number of symptoms you have. The needles may be inserted just under the skin, or deeper so they reach muscle tissue. Once the needles are in place, they may be left in position for a length of time lasting from a few minutes up to around 30 minutes. You may feel a tingling or a dull ache when the needles are inserted but shouldn't experience any significant pain. If you do, let your practitioner know straight away. In some cases, your practitioner may rotate the needles or stimulate them with a mild electric current (known as electroacupuncture). There's no statutory regulation of acupuncture in England, but many non-medical acupuncture practitioners are required to register with their local authority. If you choose to have acupuncture, make sure your acupuncture practitioner is either a regulated healthcare professional such as a doctor, nurse of physiotherapist or a member of a recognised national acupuncture organisation. The British Acupuncture Council holds a register of practitioners that has been vetted and approved by the Professional Standards Authority. If you decide to have traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture, you can visit this website to find a qualified acupuncturist near you. When it's carried out by a qualified practitioner, acupuncture is generally very safe. Some people experience mild, short-lived side effects such as: pain where the needles puncture the skin bleeding or bruising where the needles puncture the skin drowsiness feeling sick feeling dizzy or faint worsening of pre-existing symptoms If you have a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia, or are taking anticoagulants, talk to your GP before you have acupuncture.  Acupuncture is also not usually advised if you have a metal allergy or an infection in the area where needles may be inserted. It's generally safe to have acupuncture when you're pregnant. However, let your acupuncture practitioner know if you're pregnant because certain acupuncture points can't be used safely during pregnancy.

However, it can be a problem if you find it difficult to keep it under control. \"You can control your anger, and you have a responsibility to do so,\" says clinical psychologist Isabel Clarke, a specialist in anger management. Dealing with anger Managing anger in the long term Let go of angry thoughts Anxiety, fear and anger Domestic violence and anger Getting help with anger \"Everyone has a physical reaction to anger. Be aware of what your body is telling you, and take steps to calm yourself down,\" says Isabel. ","Breathe slowly":"Breathe out for longer than you breathe in, and relax as you breathe out. \"You automatically breathe in more than out when you\u2019re feeling angry, and the trick is to breathe out more than in,\" says Isabel. \"This will calm you down effectively and help you think more clearly.\" Once you can recognise that you\u2019re getting angry, and can calm yourself down, you can start looking at ways to control your anger more generally.  ","Exercise can help with anger":"Bring down your general stress levels with exercise and relaxation. Running, walking, swimming, yoga and meditation are just a few activities that can reduce stress. \"Exercise as part of your daily life is a good way to get rid of irritation and anger,\" says Isabel. ","Recognise your anger signs":"Your heart beats faster and you breathe more quickly, preparing you for action. You might also notice other signs, such as tension in your shoulders or clenching your fists. \"If you notice these signs, get out of the situation if you\u2019ve got a history of losing control,\" says Isabel. ","Looking after yourself may keep you calm":"Make time to relax regularly, and ensure that you get enough sleep. Drugs and alcohol can make anger problems worse. \"They lower inhibitions and, actually, we need inhibitions to stop us acting unacceptably when we\u2019re angry,\" says Isabel. ","Get creative":"Writing, making music, dancing or painting can release tension and reduce feelings of anger. ","Count to 10":"Counting to 10 gives you time to cool down, so you can think more clearly and overcome the impulse to lash out. ","URL":"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/controlling-anger.aspx","Talk about how you feel":"Discussing your feelings with a friend can be useful and can help you get a different perspective on the situation. \"Try to let go of any unhelpful ways of thinking,\" says Isabel. \"Thoughts such as 'It\u2019s not fair,' or 'People like that shouldn\u2019t be on the roads,' can make anger worse.\" Thinking like this will keep you focused on whatever it is that\u2019s making you angry. Let these thoughts go and it will be easier to calm down. Try to avoid using phrases that include: always (for example, \"You always do that.\") never (\"You never listen to me.\") should or shouldn't (\"You should do what I want,\" or \"You shouldn't be on the roads.\") must or mustn't (\"I must be on time,\" or \"I mustn't be late.\") ought or oughtn't (\"People ought to get out of my way.\") not fair Sometimes when people talk about \"anger\" what they actually mean is aggression, says Dr James Woollard, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. \"Often when people experience or appear to show anger, it\u2019s because they are also feeling fear or perceive a threat, and they are responding with a 'fight' response to this.\" \"Asking yourself, 'What might I be scared of?' can give you a different set of choices about how to respond,\" says Dr Woollard. \"You might be angry that something has not gone your way. But you may also be scared that you might be blamed or hurt as result. Recognising this might allow you to think and act differently.\" Read more on how to manage your anxiety. \"Managing your anger is as much about managing your happiness and contentment as your anger,\" adds Dr Woollard. \"It should be a part of developing your emotional intelligence and resilience.\" If uncontrolled anger leads to domestic violence (violence or threatening behaviour within the home), there are places that offer help and support. You can talk to your GP or contact domestic violence organisations such as Refuge, Women's Aid or the Alternatives to Violence Project. Read about getting help for domestic abuse. If you feel you need help dealing with your anger, see your GP. There might be local anger management courses or counselling that could help you. There are private courses and therapists who can help with anger issues. Make sure any therapist you see is registered with a professional organisation, such as the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy. ","Anger management programmes":"A typical anger management programme may involve one-to-one counselling and working in a small group. The programmes can consist of a one-day or weekend course. In some cases, it may be over a couple of months. The structure of the programmes can differ, depending on who is providing it, but most programmes include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as counselling. "},"Title":"How to control your anger"},"Adhesive capsulitis":{"Treatment":{"Treating frozen shoulder ":"Treatment for a frozen shoulder will vary, depending on the stage of the condition and the severity of your pain and stiffness. A frozen shoulder may get better over time without treatment, but recovery is often slow and can take at least 18 to 24 months. In some people, the condition may not improve for five years or more. A number of different treatments can be used to treat frozen shoulder, although it's uncertain how effective they are and which is best. The treatments described below can help reduce shoulder pain and keep the joint mobile while the shoulder heals. ","Early stage treatments":"The first stage of a frozen shoulder is the most painful. Therefore, treatment is mainly focused on relieving the pain. During this stage, your GP may recommend avoiding movements that make the pain worse, such as stretching. However, you shouldn't stop moving altogether. If you're in pain, you may be prescribed painkillers, such as: paracetamol a combination of paracetamol and codeine a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) \u2013 such as ibuprofen Some painkillers are also available from pharmacies without a prescription. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and make sure you're taking the correct dose. Taking painkillers, particularly NSAIDs, in the long term can increase your risk of side effects. See the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication for more information. Read more about the side effects of NSAIDs. If painkillers aren't helping to control the pain, it may be possible to have a corticosteroid injection in your shoulder joint. Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic. These injections can help relieve pain and improve the movement in your shoulder. However, injections won't cure your condition and your symptoms may gradually return. Corticosteroid injections won't be used after the pain has gone from your shoulder and only the stiffness remains. Having too many corticosteroid injections may damage your shoulder, and the injections often become less effective over time, so your doctor may recommend having no more than three injections. You'll need at least three to four weeks between these. Read more about corticosteroids. ","Surgery and procedures":"It's uncommon to need surgery for a frozen shoulder, but it may be recommended if your symptoms are severe and other treatments haven't worked after six months. If this happens, you may be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in conditions that affect the bones and joints). Some of the procedures used to treat frozen shoulder are described below. If you're finding the pain and movement restriction difficult to cope with, you can have your shoulder manipulated (moved) while you're under general anaesthetic. During this procedure, your shoulder will be moved, in a controlled way, to stretch the sleeve (shoulder capsule) surrounding the shoulder joint. After the procedure you'll usually have corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injected into your shoulder joint to help reduce any pain or swelling. You can normally go home the same day. Physiotherapy is usually recommended afterwards to help maintain mobility in your shoulder. Arthroscopic capsular release is an alternative procedure to manipulation. It's a type of minimally invasive or \"keyhole\" surgery, carried out under general anaesthetic, where two or three small incisions are made around your shoulder. The surgeon will insert a thin tube containing a light and camera (arthroscope) into one of the incisions, so they can see inside your shoulder. A special probe that emits high-frequency radio waves is inserted through the other incisions, and this is used to divide or cut out the thickened parts of the shoulder capsule. Opening up the shoulder capsule in this way should greatly improve your range of movement. As with manipulation, you can usually go home the same day you have this operation, and you'll probably need physiotherapy afterwards to help you regain a full range of movement in your shoulder joint. Stretching exercises need to be continued for at least three months after surgery. Shoulder stiffness may return, despite manipulation or surgery, and further treatment may be necessary. Although it's less commonly performed than the operations described above, a procedure called arthrographic distension or hydrodilatation may sometimes be recommended to treat your frozen shoulder. This treatment is carried out under local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while it's carried out, but your shoulder will be numbed. It may be performed by a specialist orthopaedic surgeon using a local anaesthetic and corticosteroids, or saline with corticosteroids. X-ray guidance may sometimes be needed. This procedure usually only takes about 15 minutes, and you can go home the same day. As with the other procedures described above, physiotherapy may be recommended afterwards to help you regain a good range of movement in your shoulder. There's some evidence that hydrodilatation may result in less pain and greater movement, although the effects may be no better than a corticosteroid injection.

Your GP may suggest stretching exercises, and you may also be referred to a physiotherapist. If you have a frozen shoulder, it's important to keep your shoulder joint mobile with regular, gentle stretching exercises. Not using your shoulder could make the stiffness worse, so you should continue to use it as normal. However, if your shoulder is very stiff, exercise may be painful. Your GP or physiotherapist can give you some simple exercises to do every day at home that won't damage your shoulder any more. A physiotherapist can use a number of techniques to keep the movement and flexibility in your shoulder. If you're referred to one, you may have treatments including: stretching exercises that use specific techniques to move the joint in all directions massage thermotherapy, with warm or cold temperature packs There's no clinical evidence to show that certain other treatments are effective in treating frozen shoulder, including: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) Shiatsu massage acupuncture Read more about physiotherapy.

"}},"Astigmatism":{"Treatment":{"Laser eye surgery":"Laser surgery involves using lasers (narrow beams of light) to remould the tissue of the cornea to change its curve. Laser surgery to correct astigmatism isn't usually available free of charge on the NHS as it's not considered an essential medical treatment and other effective treatments are available, such as glasses and contact lenses. However, in 2011 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced corrective laser surgery could be a treatment option on the NHS to improve vision after previous eye surgery. For more information, see NICE guidance: laser correction of refractive error following non-refractive ophthalmic surgery (PDF, 96.8kb). If you decide to have laser eye surgery, you'll have one or more appointments at a specialist eye clinic. During laser surgery, the outer layer of cells of the corneal surface is removed. A laser is then used to remove tissue and change the shape of the cornea and the cornea is left to heal. The treatment usually takes 20 to 30 minutes. There are a number of different techniques used for laser surgery. Your specialist should discuss the pros and cons of each technique with you, including any risks involved. The risks of complications associated with eye surgery are low. Read more about laser eye surgery. Page last reviewed: 17/10/2014 Next review due: 17/10/2017 ","Treating astigmatism ":"In many cases, the symptoms of astigmatism are so mild that treatment to correct vision isn't required. If treatment is needed, the type that's recommended will depend on the type of astigmatism you have (regular or irregular). Treatment will usually be in the form of corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses) or laser eye surgery. ","Corrective lenses":"Corrective lenses work by compensating for the irregular curve of the cornea so incoming light passing through the corrective lens is properly focused on to the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye. Glasses and contact lenses are usually equally effective at treating astigmatism. The type of corrective lenses you decide to use will therefore depend on your personal preference and the advice of your optometrist. There's no medical reason why children can't wear contact lenses, although the opinion of your optometrist will be important in deciding if they're suitable. Most children over 12 years of age will be able to wear them. However, it's important your child is able to use their lenses correctly. They must be able to follow any instructions related to their lenses, such as how long to keep them in and when to clean them. If you choose to wear contact lenses, it's important to ensure good lens hygiene to prevent eye infections developing. Read more about contact lens safety. ","URL":"/conditions/Astigmatism"},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Astigmatism is a common and usually minor eye condition that causes blurred or distorted vision. It occurs when the cornea or lens isn't a perfectly curved shape. Many people who wear glasses have some degree of astigmatism. Astigmatism belongs to a group of related eye conditions known as refractive errors. Other common refractive errors include: short-sightedness (myopia) long-sightedness (hypermetropia) If you have astigmatism, it's likely you'll also have one of these conditions. Left untreated, astigmatism can cause headaches, eye strain and fatigue (tiredness), particularly after doing tasks that involve focusing on something for long periods, such as reading or using a computer. ","Types of astigmatism":"There are two types of astigmatism \u2013 regular and irregular. Regular astigmatism is where the cornea is curved more in one direction than the other. It's more common than irregular astigmatism and can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Irregular astigmatism is where the curvature of the cornea isn't even across the surface of the eye. Instead of being curved mostly in one direction, it could be curved in multiple directions, or the curve could be steeper towards the bottom. Irregular astigmatism is often the result of an eye injury that causes a scar to develop on the cornea. It can't be corrected with glasses, but it can be corrected with contact lenses. ","Diagnosing astigmatism":"Astigmatism is usually diagnosed after a routine eye test. It's very important for you and your children to have regular eye tests because astigmatism sometimes goes undiagnosed for years, and it can affect your or your child's ability to read and concentrate. Read more about diagnosing astigmatism. ","Treating astigmatism":"In many cases, the symptoms of astigmatism are so mild that treatment isn't needed to correct your vision. In cases where your vision is significantly affected by astigmatism, glasses or contact lenses can be used to correct it. In adults, laser treatment can also be used to permanently correct astigmatism. However, it's unlikely you'll be able to receive laser treatment through the NHS. Read more about treating astigmatism.

The cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the front of the eye. The cornea should be regularly curved like the surface of a football, but in cases of astigmatism it has an irregular curve, more like the shape of a rugby ball. This means that light rays entering the eye aren't focused properly, creating a blurred image. In most cases, astigmatism is present at birth. However, it sometimes develops after an eye injury or as a complication of an eye operation. Read more about the causes of astigmatism. "},"Causes":{"The cornea and lens":"The cornea is a transparent layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye and helps protect the eye from damage. The cornea and lens are also responsible for focusing incoming light on to the retina to create a clear image. To work properly, the cornea needs to be perfectly curved, like the surface of a football. However, in astigmatism the cornea is shaped irregularly, like the surface of a rugby ball. When light hits an irregularly curved cornea, it's not focused correctly on to the retina. The incorrect focus blurs the image, resulting in blurred vision. Astigmatism caused by problems with the cornea is known as corneal astigmatism. The same problem can also sometimes be caused by an irregular-shaped lens that bends light unevenly in the eye. This is known as lenticular astigmatism. It's not known why some people are born with astigmatism, but there may be a hereditary element. ","Other causes":"Other possible causes of astigmatism include: injuries to the cornea, such as an infection that scars the cornea  changes to the cornea caused by eye surgery keratoconus and keratoglobus \u2013 eye conditions that cause the cornea to bulge, get thinner and change shape some conditions that affect the eyelids and distort the cornea  other conditions that affect the cornea or lens Page last reviewed: 17/10/2014 Next review due: 17/10/2017 ","How the eye works":"The eye is made up of three functional components. They are the: optical system (cornea and lens) \u2013 the cornea and lens are positioned at the front of the eye and act like the lenses of a camera, focusing the light coming into the eye to form an image on the retina retina \u2013 the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye that senses light and colour and converts them into electrical signals optic nerve \u2013 the \"cable\" that transmits the electrical signals from the retina to the brain, where they're interpreted and understood Astigmatism usually occurs as a result of problems with the cornea or lens. ","URL":"/conditions/Astigmatism","Causes of astigmatism ":"The vision problems caused by astigmatism are a result of defects within the eye. These defects are usually present from birth. "},"Title":"Astigmatism","Diagnosis":{"Diagnosing astigmatism ":"Astigmatism is usually diagnosed after a routine eye test. ","Regular eye tests":"Most people who have astigmatism are born with the condition, so it's important your children have regular eye tests. Children may not realise there's anything wrong with their vision. If their vision isn't regularly tested, conditions like astigmatism could remain undiagnosed for many years, which can cause a lazy eye. If a child has uncorrected astigmatism, they may have difficulty reading and concentrating at school. Your baby will have their eyes examined at birth or shortly afterwards (within 72 hours) to check for any obvious defects. They'll have a second eye examination when they're between 6 and 8 weeks old, which will usually be carried out by your GP. Your child's vision may also be checked when they start school at around five years of age, but this varies depending on where you live. Read more about children's routine eye tests. If your child has suspected vision problems, they may be referred to an orthoptist. An orthoptist specialises in problems relating to eye movements and vision development. They usually work in local health clinics or hospital eye clinics. Eyesight problems may also be investigated by an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specialises in diagnosing and treating eye conditions). They mainly work in hospitals and hospital eye departments. You may also see an optometrist. Optometrists examine eyes, test sight, and prescribe glasses and contact lenses. They're trained to recognise eye conditions and sight defects. If your child's vision has been checked and is normal, they should continue to have regular eye checks about once every year. Adults should have an eye test at least once every two years, unless advised otherwise by their optometrist. Read more about children's eyes and NHS eye care services. ","Testing for astigmatism":"A number of tests can be used if astigmatism is suspected. The two most common tests are the visual acuity test and the keratometer test. A visual acuity test can be used to assess your or your child's ability to focus on objects at different distances. It usually involves reading letters on a chart called a Snellen chart. The letters become progressively smaller on each line of the chart. A device called a keratometer can measure the degree of corneal astigmatism. It measures how light is being focused by the cornea and can detect irregularities in the curve of the cornea.

It's usually a complication of a serious existing health condition. Most people have therefore already been admitted to hospital by the time they develop ARDS. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Symptoms of ARDS can include: severe shortness of breath rapid, shallow breathing tiredness, drowsiness or confusion feeling faint ","When to get urgent medical help":"Although most people develop ARDS when they're already in hospital, this isn't always the case. It can develop quickly as a result of an infection such as pneumonia, or if someone accidentally inhales their vomit. Dial 999 immediately to ask for an ambulance if a child or adult is having breathing problems. ARDS occurs when the lungs become severely inflamed due to an infection or injury. The inflammation causes fluid from nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in your lungs, making breathing increasingly difficult. The lungs can become inflamed following: pneumonia or severe flu blood poisoning  a severe chest injury   accidental inhalation of vomit, smoke or toxic chemicals near drowning acute pancreatitis \u2013 a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time  an adverse reaction to a blood transfusion There's no specific test to diagnose ARDS. A full assessment is needed to identify the underlying cause and rule out other conditions. The assessment is likely to include: a physical examination blood tests \u2013 to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood and check for an infection a pulse oximetry test \u2013 where a sensor attached to the fingertip, ear or toe is used to measure how much oxygen the blood is absorbing a chest X-ray and a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 to look for evidence of ARDS an echocardiogram \u2013 a type of ultrasound scan that's used to look at the heart and nearby blood vessels If you develop ARDS, you'll probably be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and put on a breathing machine (ventilator) to help your breathing. This involves breathing through a mask attached to the machine. In severe cases, a breathing tube may be inserted down your throat and into your lungs. Fluids and nutrients will be supplied through a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) that's passed through your nose and into your stomach. The underlying cause of ARDS should also be treated. For example, if it's caused by a bacterial infection, you may need antibiotics. How long you'll need to stay in hospital depends on your individual circumstances and the cause of ARDS. Most people respond well to treatment, but it may be several weeks or months before you're well enough to leave hospital. As ARDS is often caused by a serious health condition, about one in three people who develop it will die. However, most deaths are caused by the underlying illness, rather than ARDS itself. For people who survive, the main complications are associated with nerve and muscle damage, which causes pain and weakness. Some people also develop psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The lungs usually recover and long-term lung failure after ARDS is rare.

Many antihistamines are available from your pharmacist without prescription \u2013 stock up in case of an emergency. Non-drowsy antihistamines are preferred. Some antihistamines, such as alimemazine and promethazine, aren't suitable for children under the age of two. If you have a younger child with a food allergy, ask your GP about what types of antihistamines may be suitable. Avoid drinking alcohol after taking an antihistamine as this can make you feel drowsy and affect your ability to drive. ","Treating a food allergy ":"There are two main types of medication that can be used to relieve the symptoms of an allergic reaction to foods: antihistamines \u2013 used to treat mild to moderate allergic reaction adrenaline \u2013 used to treat severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) ","Adrenaline":"Adrenaline works by narrowing the blood vessels to counteract the effects of low blood pressure and opening up the airways to help ease breathing difficulties. You'll be given an auto-injector of adrenaline to use in case of emergencies if you or your child is at risk of anaphylaxis or had a previous episode of anaphylaxis. Read the manufacturer's instructions that come with the auto-injector carefully and train your child how to use it when they are old enough. ","Owning an auto-injector":"As a precaution, the following advice should be taken:  Carry the auto-injector at all times or encourage your child to do so if they're old enough. You may be prescribed two injectors \u2013 check with your GP or the doctor in charge of your care. You may also be given an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your child's allergy and the contact details of their doctor to alert others. They should wear this at all times. Extreme temperatures can make adrenaline less effective. Don't leave an auto-injector in places like your fridge or the glove compartment of your car. Check the expiry date regularly. An out-of-date injector will only offer limited protection. The manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the date of expiry. Check the information leaflet that comes with the medication for more information. If your child has an auto-injector, they'll need to change over to an adult dose once they reach a weight of 30 kilos (4.7 stone). Depending on the shape and size of your child's body, this could be anywhere between the ages of 5 and 11 years old. Don't delay injecting if you think you or your child may be experiencing the start of anaphylaxis, even if the initial symptoms are mild. It's better to use adrenaline early and find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you're sure your child is experiencing severe anaphylaxis.  Page last reviewed: 16/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","Using an auto-injector":"If you suspect that somebody is experiencing the symptoms of anaphylaxis, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Tell the operator that you think the person has anaphylaxis. Older children and adults will probably have been trained to inject themselves. You may need to inject younger children or older children and adults who are too sick to inject themselves. There are three types of auto-injectors: EpiPen Jext Emerade All three work in much the same way. If anaphylaxis is suspected, you should remove the safety cap from the injector and press firmly against the thigh, holding it at a right angle, without using the thumb at the end. A \"click\" indicates the auto-injector has been activated, and it should be held in place for 10 seconds. Ensure you're familiar with the device and know the correct end to place against the thigh. The injections can be given through clothing. This will send a needle into your thigh and deliver a dose of adrenaline. If the person is unconscious, check their airways are open and clear, and check their breathing. Then put them in the recovery position. Putting someone who is unconscious in the recovery position ensures they don't choke on their vomit. Place the person on their side, making sure they're supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin. If the person's breathing or heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed. ","URL":"/conditions/food-allergy"},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"A food allergy is when the body's immune system reacts unusually to specific foods. Although allergic reactions are often mild, they can be very serious. Symptoms of a food allergy can affect different areas of the body at the same time. Some common symptoms include: an itchy sensation inside the mouth, throat or ears a raised itchy red rash (urticaria, or \"hives\") swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue and roof of the mouth (angioedema) vomiting Read more about the symptoms of food allergies. ","Anaphylaxis":"In the most serious cases, a person has a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening. If you think someone has the symptoms of anaphylaxis \u2013 such as breathing difficulties, lightheadedness, and feeling like they're going to faint or lose consciousness \u2013 call 999. Ask for an ambulance and tell the operator you think the person has anaphylaxis or \"anaphylactic shock\". ","Treatment":"The best way of preventing an allergic reaction is to identify the food that causes the allergy and avoid it. Research is currently looking at ways to desensitise some food allergens, such as peanuts and milk, but this is not an established treatment. Read more about identifying foods that cause allergies (allergens). Avoid making any radical changes, such as cutting out dairy products, to your or your child's diet without first talking to your GP. For some foods, such as milk, you may need to speak to a dietitian before making any changes. A type of medication called an antihistamine can help relieve the symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction. A higher dose of antihistamine is often needed to control acute allergic symptoms. Adrenaline is an effective treatment for more severe allergic symptoms, such as anaphylaxis. People with a food allergy are often given a device known as an auto-injector pen, which contains doses of adrenaline that can be used in emergencies. Read more about the treatment of food allergies.  ","When to seek medical advice":"If you think you or your child may have a food allergy, it's very important to ask for a professional diagnosis from your GP. They can then refer you to an allergy clinic if appropriate. Many parents mistakenly assume their child has a food allergy when their symptoms are actually caused by a completely different condition. Commercial allergy testing kits are available, but using them isn't recommended. Many kits are based on unsound scientific principles. Even if they're reliable, you should have the results looked at by a health professional. Read more about diagnosing food allergies. ","What causes food allergies?":"Food allergies happen when the immune system \u2013 the body's defence against infection \u2013 mistakenly treats proteins found in food as a threat. As a result, a number of chemicals are released. It's these chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Almost any food can cause an allergic reaction, but there are certain foods that are responsible for most food allergies. In children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: milk eggs peanuts tree nuts fish shellfish Most children that have a food allergy will have experienced eczema during infancy. The worse the child's eczema and the earlier it started, the more likely they are to have a food allergy. In adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: peanuts tree nuts \u2013 such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and hazelnuts fruits \u2013 such as apples and peaches fish shellfish \u2013 such as crab, lobster and prawns It's still unknown why people develop allergies to food, although they often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever and eczema. Read more information about the causes and risk factors for food allergies. ","What is food intolerance?":"A food intolerance isn't the same as a food allergy. People with food intolerance may have symptoms such as diarrhoea, bloating and stomach cramps. This may be caused by difficulties digesting certain substances, such as lactose. However, no allergic reaction takes place. Important differences between a food allergy and a food intolerance include: the symptoms of a food intolerance usually occur several hours after eating the food you need to eat a larger amount of food to trigger an intolerance than an allergy a food intolerance is never life threatening, unlike an allergy Read more about food intolerance. Page last reviewed: 16/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","Who's affected?":"Most food allergies affect younger children under the age of three. It's estimated around 1 in every 14 children of this age has at least one food allergy. Most children who have food allergies to milk, eggs, soya and wheat in early life will grow out of it by the time they start school. Peanut and tree nut allergies are usually more persistent. An estimated four out of five children with peanut allergies remain allergic to peanuts for the rest of their lives. Food allergies that develop during adulthood, or persist into adulthood, are likely to be lifelong allergies. For reasons that are unclear, rates of food allergies have risen sharply in the last 20 years. However, deaths from anaphylaxis-related food reactions are now rare. There are around 10 deaths related to food allergies in England and Wales each year. There are many myths about food allergies and intolerances \u2013 can you tell fact from fiction? And what is the difference between the two?   ","URL":"/conditions/food-allergy","Types of food allergies":"Food allergies are divided into three types, depending on symptoms and when they occur. IgE-mediated food allergy \u2013 the most common type, triggered by the immune system producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptoms occur a few seconds or minutes after eating. There's a greater risk of anaphylaxis with this type of allergy. non-IgE-mediated food allergy \u2013 these allergic reactions aren't caused by immunoglobulin E, but by other cells in the immune system. This type of allergy is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms take much longer to develop (up to several hours). mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated food allergies \u2013 some people may experience symptoms from both types. Read more information about the symptoms of a food allergy. Some people experience itchiness in their mouth and throat, sometimes with mild swelling, immediately after eating fresh fruit or vegetables. This is known as oral allergy syndrome. Oral allergy syndrome is caused by allergy antibodies mistaking certain proteins in fresh fruits, nuts or vegetables for pollen. Oral allergy syndrome generally doesn't cause severe symptoms, and it's possible to deactivate the allergens by thoroughly cooking any fruit and vegetables. Some people with pollen-food syndrome may have more severe symptoms. The Allergy UK website has more information on oral allergy syndrome. "},"Causes":{"The immune system":"The immune system protects the body by producing specialised proteins called antibodies. Antibodies identify potential threats to your body, such as bacteria and viruses. They signal your immune system to release chemicals to kill the threat and prevent the spread of infection. In the most common type of food allergy, an antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) mistakenly targets a certain protein found in food as a threat. IgE can cause several chemicals to be released, the most important being histamine. Histamine causes most of the typical symptoms that occur during an allergic reaction. For example, histamine: causes small blood vessels to expand and the surrounding skin to become red and swell up affects nerves in the skin, causing itchiness increases the amount of mucus produced in your nose lining, which causes itching and a burning sensation In most food allergies, the release of histamine is limited to certain parts of the body, such as your mouth, throat or skin. In anaphylaxis, the immune system goes into overdrive and releases massive amounts of histamine and many other chemicals into your blood. This causes the wide range of symptoms associated with anaphylaxis. ","Who's at risk?":"Exactly what causes the immune system to mistake harmless proteins as a threat is unclear. However, a number of risk factors for food allergies have been identified, which are outlined below. If you have a parent, brother or sister with an allergic condition \u2013 such as asthma, eczema or a food allergy \u2013 you have a slightly higher risk of developing a food allergy. However, you may not develop the same food allergy as your family members. Children who have atopic dermatitis (eczema) in early life are more likely to develop a food allergy. ","Food additives":"It's rare for someone to have an allergic reaction to food additives. However, certain additives may cause a flare-up of symptoms in people with pre-existing conditions. Sulphur dioxide (E220) and other sulphites (E221, E222, E223, E224, E226, E227 and E228) are used as preservatives in a wide range of foods, especially soft drinks, sausages, burgers, and dried fruits and vegetables. Sulphur dioxide is produced naturally when wine and beer are made, and is sometimes added to wine. Anyone who has asthma or allergic rhinitis may react to inhaling sulphur dioxide. A few people with asthma have had an attack after drinking acidic drinks containing sulphites, but this isn't thought to be very common. Food labelling rules require pre-packed food sold in the UK, and the rest of the European Union, to show clearly on the label if it contains sulphur dioxide or sulphites at levels above 10mg per kg or per litre. Benzoic acid (E210) and other benzoates (E211, E212, E213, E214, E215, E218 and E219) are used as food preservatives to prevent yeasts and moulds growing, most commonly in soft drinks. They occur naturally in fruit and honey. Benzoates could make the symptoms of asthma and eczema worse in children who already have these conditions. Page last reviewed: 16/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","The rise in food allergy cases":"The number of people with food allergies has risen sharply over the past few decades and, although the reason is unclear, other allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis have also increased. One theory behind the rise is that a typical child's diet has changed considerably over the last 30 to 40 years. Another theory is that children are increasingly growing up in \"germ-free\" environments. This means their immune systems may not receive sufficient early exposure to the germs needed to develop properly. This is known as the hygiene hypothesis. ","Foods":"In children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: eggs milk \u2013 if a child has an allergy to cow's milk, they're probably allergic to all types of milk, as well as infants' and follow-on formula soya wheat peanuts In adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: peanuts tree nuts \u2013 such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and pistachios fish shellfish \u2013 such as crab, lobster and prawns However, any type of food can potentially cause an allergy. Allergic reactions have been reported in association with: celery or celeriac \u2013 this can sometimes cause anaphylactic shock gluten \u2013 a type of protein found in cereals mustard sesame seeds fruit and vegetables \u2013 these usually only cause symptoms affecting the mouth, lips and throat (oral allergy syndrome) pine nuts (a type of seed) meat \u2013 some people are allergic to just one type of meat, while others are allergic to a range of meats; a common symptom is skin irritation ","Non-IgE-mediated food allergy":"There's another type of food allergy known as a non-IgE-mediated food allergy, caused by different cells in the immune system. This is much harder to diagnose as there's no test to accurately confirm non-IgE-mediated food allergy. This type of reaction is largely confined to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion and eczema. In babies, a non-IgE-mediated food allergy can also cause diarrhoea and reflux, where stomach acid leaks up into the throat. ","URL":"/conditions/food-allergy","Causes of a food allergy ":"A food allergy is caused by your immune system handling harmless proteins in certain foods as a threat. It releases a number of chemicals, which trigger an allergic reaction. "},"Title":"Food allergy ","Diagnosis":{"Questions to ask":"If your child is diagnosed with a food allergy, or you're an adult who has just been diagnosed with a food allergy, you may want to ask questions such as: What type of allergy is it? What are the chances of having a severe allergic reaction? Will the allergy have an impact on other areas of my or my child's health, such as diet, nutrition and vaccination? Some vaccines contain traces of egg protein. Is my child likely to grow out of their allergy and, if so, when? Page last reviewed: 16/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","Referral to an allergy clinic":"If your GP suspects a food allergy, you may be referred to an allergy clinic or centre for testing. The tests needed can vary, depending on the type of allergy: if the symptoms developed quickly (an IgE-mediated food allergy) \u2013 you'll probably be given a skin-prick test or a blood test if the symptoms developed more slowly (non-IgE-mediated food allergy) \u2013 you'll probably be put on a food elimination diet There is more information on these tests below. During a skin-prick test, drops of standardised extracts of foods are placed on the arm. The skin is then pierced with a small lancet, which allows the allergen to come into contact with the cells of your immune system. Occasionally, your doctor may perform the test using a sample of the food thought to cause a reaction. Itching, redness and swelling usually indicates a positive reaction. This test is usually painless. A skin-prick test does have a small theoretical chance of causing anaphylaxis, but testing will be carried out where there are facilities to deal with this \u2013 usually an allergy clinic, hospital, or larger GP surgery. An alternative to a skin-prick test is a blood test, which measures the amount of allergic antibodies in the blood. In a food elimination diet, the food thought to have caused the allergic reaction is withdrawn from the diet for two to six weeks. The food is then reintroduced. If the symptoms go away when the food is withdrawn but return once the food is introduced again, this normally suggests a food allergy or intolerance. Before starting the diet, you should be given advice from a dietitian on issues such as: the food and drinks you need to avoid how you should interpret food labels if any alternative sources of nutrition are needed how long the diet should last Don't attempt a food elimination diet by yourself without discussing it with a qualified health professional. ","Diagnosing food allergy  ":"If you think you or your child has a food allergy, make an appointment with your GP. They will ask you some questions about the pattern of your child's symptoms, such as: How long did it take for the symptoms to start after exposure to the food? How long did the symptoms last? How severe were the symptoms? Is this the first time these symptoms have occurred? If not, how often have they occurred? What food was involved and how much of it did your child eat? They'll also want to know about your child's medical history, such as: Do they have any other allergies or allergic conditions? Is there a history of allergies in the family? Was (or is) your child breastfed or bottle-fed? Your GP may also assess your child's weight and size to make sure they're growing at the expected rate. ","Alternative tests":"There are several shop-bought tests available that claim to detect allergies, but should be avoided. They include: vega testing \u2013 claims to detect allergies by measuring changes in your electromagnetic field kinesiology testing \u2013 claims to detect food allergies by studying your muscle responses hair analysis \u2013 claims to detect food allergies by taking a sample of your hair and running a series of tests on it alternative blood tests (leukocytotoxic tests) \u2013 claim to detect food allergies by checking for the \"swelling of white blood cells\" Many alternative testing kits are expensive, the scientific principles they are allegedly based on are unproven, and independent reviews have found them to be unreliable. They should therefore be avoided. ","URL":"/conditions/food-allergy"},"Living with":{"Further advice":"Here's some more advice for parents:  notify your child's school about their allergy \u2013 depending on how severe their allergy is, it may be necessary to give the staff at their school an emergency action plan in case of accidental exposure. Arrange for the school nurse or another staff member to hold a supply of adrenalin. Food allergy bracelets, which explain how other people can help your child in an emergency, are also available. let other parents know \u2013 young children may easily forget about their food allergy and accept food they shouldn't have when visiting other children. Telling the parents of your child's friends about their allergy should help prevent this. educate your child \u2013 once your child is old enough to understand their allergy, it's important to give them clear, simple instructions about what foods to avoid and what they should do if they accidentally eat them.  ","Your child's diet":"There's currently no cure for food allergies, although many children will grow out of certain ones, such as allergies to milk and eggs. The most effective way you can prevent symptoms is to remove the offending food \u2013 known as an allergen \u2013 from their diet. However, it's important to check with your GP or the doctor in charge of your child's care first before eliminating certain foods. Removing eggs or peanuts from a child's diet isn't going to have much of an impact on their nutrition. Both of these are a good source of protein, but can be replaced by other, alternative sources. A milk allergy can have more of an impact as milk is a good source of calcium, but there are many other ways you can incorporate calcium into your child's diet, including green leafy vegetables. Many foods and drinks are fortified with extra calcium. See your GP if you're concerned that your child's allergy is affecting their growth and development. ","Unpackaged food":"Currently, unpackaged food doesn't need to be labelled in the same way as packaged food. This can make it more difficult to know what ingredients are in a particular dish. Examples of unpackaged food include food sold from: bakeries \u2013 including in-store bakeries in supermarkets delis salad bars \"ready-to-eat\" sandwich shops takeaways restaurants If you or your child have a severe food allergy, you need to be careful when you eat out. The following advice should help: let the staff know \u2013 when booking a table at a restaurant, make sure the staff know about any allergies. Ask for a firm guarantee that the specific food won't be in any of the dishes served. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) offers chef cards that provide information about allergies, which you can give to restaurant staff. As well as informing the chef and kitchen staff involved in cooking your food, let waiters and waitresses know so they understand the importance of avoiding cross-contamination when serving you. read the menu carefully and check for hidden ingredients \u2013 some food types contain other foods that can trigger allergies, which restaurant staff may have overlooked. Some desserts contain nuts (such as a cheesecake base) and some sauces contain wheat and peanuts. prepare for the worst \u2013 it's a good idea to prepare for any eventuality. Always take anti-allergy medication with you when eating out, particularly an adrenalin auto-injector. Read more about treating food allergies with a auto-injector. use what's known as a taste test in older children \u2013 before your child begins to eat, ask them to take a tiny portion of the food and rub it against their lips to see if they experience a tingling or burning sensation. If they do, it suggests that the food will cause them to have an allergic reaction. However, the taste test doesn't work for all foods, so it shouldn't be used as a substitute for the above advice. ","Living with a food allergy  ":"The advice here is primarily written for parents of a child with a food allergy. However, most of it is also relevant if you're an adult with a food allergy. ","Reading labels":"It's very important to check the label of any pre-packed food or drinks your child has in case it contains ingredients they're allergic to. Under EU law, any pre-packed food or drink sold in the UK must clearly state on the label if it contains the following ingredients: celery cereals that contain gluten \u2013 including wheat, rye, barley and oats crustaceans \u2013 including prawns, crabs and lobsters eggs fish lupin (common garden plants) \u2013 seeds from some varieties are sometimes used to make flour milk molluscs \u2013 including mussels and oysters mustard tree nuts \u2013 such as almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios and macadamia nuts peanuts sesame seeds soybeans sulphur dioxide and sulphites (preservatives used in some foods and drinks) \u2013 at levels above 10mg per kg or per litre Some food manufacturers also choose to put allergy advice warning labels \u2013 for example, \"contains nuts\" \u2013 on their pre-packed foods if they contain an ingredient known to commonly cause an allergic reaction, such as peanuts, wheat, eggs or milk. However, these aren't compulsory. If there's no allergy advice box or \"contains\" statement on a product, it could still have any of the 14 specified allergens in it. Look out for \"may contain\" labels, such as \"may contain traces of peanut\". Manufacturers sometimes put this label on their products to warn consumers that they may have become contaminated with another food product when being made. Read more detailed information about allergen labelling on the Food Standards Agency website. Some non-food products contain allergy-causing food: some soaps and shampoos contain soy, egg and tree nut oil some pet foods contain milk and peanuts some glues and adhesive labels used on envelopes and stamps contain traces of wheat Again, read the labels of any non-food products your child may come into close physical contact with. ","Can food allergies be prevented?":"It used to be thought that avoiding eating peanuts during pregnancy and when breastfeeding could help reduce the risk, but this theory has now been questioned. There's some evidence that introducing peanuts early in life may reduce the risk of peanut allergy, but this may not apply to all children and requires confirmation from further studies. It's important to follow the standard recommendations for pregnancy and breastfeeding, whether or not you have a family history of food allergies.

This can happen to children who have a milk allergy. ","Symptoms of a food allergy ":"The symptoms of a food allergy almost always develop a few seconds or minutes after eating the food. Some people may develop a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening. The most common type of allergic reaction to food is known as an IgE-mediated food allergy. Symptoms include: tingling or itching in the mouth a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) \u2013 in some cases, the skin can turn red and itchy, but without a raised rash swelling of the face, mouth (angioedema), throat or other areas of the body difficulty swallowing wheezing or shortness of breath feeling dizzy and lightheaded feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting abdominal pain or diarrhoea hay fever-like symptoms, such as sneezing or itchy eyes (allergic conjunctivitis) ","Anaphylaxis":"The symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can be sudden and get worse very quickly. Initial symptoms of anaphylaxis are often the same as those listed above and can lead to: increased breathing difficulties \u2013 such as wheezing and a cough a sudden and intense feeling of anxiety and fear a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) a sharp and sudden drop in your blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded and confused unconsciousness Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. Without quick treatment, it can be life threatening. If you think you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylaxis, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. ","Exercise-induced food allergy":"In some cases, a food allergy can be triggered after eating a certain food and then exercising. This can lead to anaphylaxis in severe cases, sometimes known as food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Drinking alcohol or taking an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin or ibuprofen may also trigger an allergy in people with this syndrome. Page last reviewed: 16/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019 ","Non-IgE-mediated food allergy":"Another type of allergic reaction is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. The symptoms of this type of allergy can take much longer to develop \u2013 sometimes up to several days. Some symptoms of a non IgE-mediated food allergy may be what you would expect to see in an allergic reaction, such as: redness and itchiness of the skin \u2013 although not a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) the skin becomes itchy, red, dry and cracked (atopic eczema) Other symptoms can be much less obvious and are sometimes thought of as being caused by something other than an allergy. They include: heartburn and indigestion caused by stomach acid leaking up out of the stomach (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) stools (faeces) becoming much more frequent or loose \u2013 though not necessarily diarrhoea blood and mucus in the stools in babies \u2013 excessive and inconsolable crying, even though the baby is well fed and doesn't need a nappy change (colic) constipation  redness around the anus, rectum and genitals unusually pale skin failure to grow at the expected rate ","URL":"/conditions/food-allergy"}},"Angiography":{"Risks":{" ":"Angiography is generally a very safe procedure, although minor side effects are common and there's a small risk of serious complications. The test will only be done if the benefits of having the procedure are felt to outweigh any potential risk. Speak to your doctor about the risks involved with having an angiogram. After an angiogram, many people have: bruising soreness a very small bump or collection of blood near where the cut was made These problems should improve in a few days or weeks and aren't usually anything to worry about. You can take painkillers such as paracetamol for any discomfort if you need to. Most people who have an angiogram won't experience any complications, but there is a small chance of minor or serious complications occurring. Possible minor complications include: an infection where the cut was made, causing the area to become red, hot, swollen and painful \u2013 this may need to be treated with antibiotics a mild reaction to the dye, such as an itchy rash \u2013 this can usually be controlled with medication Possible serious complications include: kidney damage due to the dye \u2013 this is usually temporary a heart attack or stroke damage to a blood vessel, causing internal bleeding \u2013 further surgery may be needed to repair the damage  a serious allergic reaction to the dye (anaphylaxis), causing dizziness, breathing difficulties or loss of consciousness These serious complications are very rare. For example, an estimated 1 in 1,000 people will have a stroke, and approximately 1 in 50,000 to 150,000 people will develop anaphylaxis. Contact your GP or the hospital for advice if: the cut starts bleeding and doesn't stop after applying pressure for a few minutes you have severe pain not relieved by painkillers your skin becomes red, swollen and hot the leg or arm where the cut was made looks or feels different to the other leg or arm \u2013 for example, it looks pale or feels cold a firm, tender lump develops near where the cut was made Page last reviewed: 13/01/2017 Next review due: 13/01/2020 ","URL":"/conditions/Angiography"},"Introduction":{" ":"Angiography is a type of X-ray used to check the blood vessels. Blood vessels don't show up clearly on a normal X-ray, so a special dye needs to be injected into your blood first. This highlights your blood vessels, allowing your doctor to spot any problems. The X-ray images created during angiography are called \"angiograms\". This page covers: Why angiograms are used What happens Risks and complications Types of angiogram Angiography is used to check the health of your blood vessels and how blood flows through them. It can be used to help diagnose or investigate a number of problems affecting the blood vessels, including: atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries), which could mean you're at risk of having a stroke or heart attack peripheral arterial disease (reduced blood supply to the leg muscles) a brain aneurysm (a bulge in a blood vessel in your brain) angina (chest pain that occurs when the blood supply to the heart muscle is restricted) blood clots or a pulmonary embolism (a blockage in the artery supplying your lungs) a blockage in the blood supply to your kidneys Angiography may also be used to help plan treatment for some of these conditions. Angiography is carried out in a hospital X-ray or radiology department. For the test: you'll usually be awake, but may be given a medication called a sedative to help you relax you lie down on a table and a small cut is made over one of your arteries, usually near your groin or wrist \u2013 local anaesthetic is used to numb the area where the cut is made a very thin flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into the artery the catheter is carefully guided to the area that's being examined (such as the heart) a dye (contrast medium) is injected into the catheter a series of X-rays are taken as the dye flows through your blood vessels The test can take between 30 minutes and two hours. You'll usually be able to go home a few hours afterwards. Read more about what happens before, during and after angiography. Angiography is generally a safe and painless procedure. But for a few days or weeks afterwards it's common to have: bruising soreness a very small lump or collection of blood near where the cut was made There is also a very small risk of more serious complications occurring, such as an allergic reaction to the dye, a stroke or a heart attack. Read more about the risks of angiography. There are several different types of angiogram, depending on which part of the body is being looked at. Common types include: coronary angiography \u2013 to check the heart and nearby blood vessels cerebral angiography \u2013 to check the blood vessels in and around the brain pulmonary angiography \u2013 to check the blood vessels supplying the lungs renal angiography \u2013 to check the blood vessels supplying the kidneys Occasionally angiography may be carried out using scans rather than X-rays. These are called computerised tomography (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. There is also a type of angiography used to check the eyes called a fluorescein angiogram.

It normally takes between 30 minutes and two hours, and you can usually go home the same day. This page covers: Preparation The procedure Afterwards Before having an angiogram, you may be asked to attend a hospital appointment to check that you can have the test. This may involve: being asked about your medical history, including if you have any allergies being asked about any medication you're taking \u2013 you'll be told if you need to stop taking it before the test having a number of tests to check your general health, including a physical examination and blood tests a discussion about the angiogram, including what it involves, what the risks are, what you need to do beforehand and whether you'd like to have sedative medication on the day to help you relax If you choose to have a sedative, you'll be asked not to eat for a few hours before the test. You'll also need to arrange for someone to pick you up from the hospital, as you won't be able to drive yourself home.  You'll usually be awake for an angiogram, although general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) may be used for young children. For the test: you'll be asked to change into a hospital gown and lie down on a special table a small cut is made in the skin over one of your arteries, usually near your groin or wrist \u2013 local anaesthetic is used to numb the area so it doesn't hurt a long, thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into the artery and is carefully guided to the area being examined \u2013 you may feel some pushing and pulling when this is done, but it shouldn't be painful a special dye (contrast agent) is injected through the catheter \u2013 you may feel warm, flushed and as though you need to pee for a few seconds after this is done a series of X-rays are taken as the dye flows through your blood vessels Sometimes treatment may be carried at the same time, such as inserting a balloon or a small tube to open up a narrowed artery. This is known as angioplasty. Once the procedure is finished, the catheter is removed and pressure is placed on the cut to stop any bleeding. Stitches aren't needed. After the test, you'll be taken to a recovery ward where you'll be asked to lie still for a few hours to prevent bleeding from the cut. You'll usually be able to go home the same day, although sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight. It may be possible to tell you the results of the test before you go home, but often the X-rays need to be studied in detail and the results are not available for a few weeks.

Your hearing may be affected if sounds don't reach the inner ear efficiently. This is known as conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss can be caused by problems such as: a blockage in your ear canal, such as a build-up of earwax a blockage in the middle ear \u2013 for example, glue ear an infection of your outer ear (otitis externa) or middle ear (otitis media) a hole or tear in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) otosclerosis, which is an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear disruption of your hearing bones caused by injury or disease Conductive hearing loss caused by these problems is often temporary and reversible. If sounds reach the inner ear but are still not heard, the fault lies in the inner ear or (rarely) in the hearing nerve. This is called sensori-neural hearing loss. Sensori-neural hearing loss may occur for a number of reasons, most commonly as a result of age-related change. This sort of hearing loss is nearly always permanent.

","Why are hearing tests needed?":"Hearing tests are carried out for two main reasons: as a routine part of a baby\u2019s or young child\u2019s developmental checks to check the hearing of someone who is experiencing hearing problems or has hearing loss It's important hearing tests are carried out so the right support and treatment can be provided. Hearing tests are carried out at regular intervals during childhood, starting with the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP) within a few weeks of birth. Your child's hearing may also be checked during a general health review when they are a few years old and before they start school for the first time. If you're worried about any hearing problems, you can ask your GP for a hearing test. Read more about when hearing tests are needed. ","What happens during a hearing test?":"Although your GP or practice nurse can examine your ears, you will usually be referred to a specialist for a hearing test. A number of different tests are used to check how well the ears are functioning and their ability to detect different levels of sound. Common hearing tests include: automated otoacoustic emissions (AOAE) tests \u2013 a computer attached to an earpiece plays clicking noises and measures the response from the ear automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) tests \u2013 sensors are placed on the head and neck to check the response of the nerves to sound played through headphones pure tone audiometry tests \u2013 sounds of different volumes and frequencies are played, usually through headphones, and a button is pressed when they are heard bone conduction tests \u2013 a vibrating noise generator sensor is placed behind the ear and presses on the bone to test how well the hearing nerve is working Generally, different tests are used for adults and children but they are all completely painless. The results of some of these tests are recorded on a graph called an audiogram, so that the type of hearing loss can be identified.

It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by norovirus (the \"winter vomiting bug\") or bacterial food poisoning. Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you're feeling better. Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or need any advice. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you have it When to get medical advice Looking after a child Getting medical advice for your child How it's spread Prevention The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are: sudden, watery diarrhoea feeling sick vomiting, which can be projectile a mild fever Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an upset stomach, aching limbs and headaches. The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer. If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you're feeling better. There's not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course. You don't usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see When to get medical advice). To help ease your symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \u2013 You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine \u2013 read about treating dehydration. Take anti-vomiting medication (such as metoclopramide) and/or antidiarrhoeal medication (such as loperamide) if you need to \u2013 some types are available from pharmacies, but check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. You can also ask your pharmacist or GP for advice about whether they're suitable.  Gastroenteritis can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see Preventing gastroenteritis). You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own. Visiting your GP surgery can put others at risk, so it's best to call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or feel you need advice. Get medical advice if: you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or if you're losing consciousness you have bloody diarrhoea you're vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids you have a fever over 38C (100.4F) your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days in the last few weeks you've returned from a part of the world with poor sanitation you have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to a laboratory to check what's causing your symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection. You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There's not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days. You don't normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see Getting medical advice for your child). To help ease your child's symptoms: Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids. They need to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is generally best. Avoid giving them fizzy drinks or fruit juice, as they can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Make sure they get plenty of rest. Let your child eat if they're eating solids and feel hungry. Try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Give them paracetamol if they have an uncomfortable fever or aches and pains. Young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they're dehydrated. Your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child. Don't give them antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist. Babies and young children, especially if they're less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. Read advice about looking after babies and children under five who have diarrhoea and vomiting. Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill and keep them away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared (see Preventing gastroenteritis). You don't usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned about your child, or they: have symptoms of dehydration, such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet have blood in their poo or green vomit are vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids or feeds have had diarrhoea for more than a week have been vomiting for three days or more have signs of a more serious illness, such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn't fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head) have a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child's poo to a laboratory to confirm what's causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection. The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person. You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with gastroenteritis \u2013 they may breathe out small particles of vomit touching contaminated surfaces or objects  eating contaminated food \u2013 this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn't been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures (read more about the causes of food poisoning) A person with gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. It's not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following the advice below can help stop it spreading: Stay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. Ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not always effective. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash. Don't share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill. Flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area. Practice good food hygiene. Make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date \u2013 read more about preventing food poisoning.  Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it. Young children can have the rotavirus vaccination when they\u2019re two to three months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis.

Typical features include: abnormally large hands and feet large, prominent facial features an enlarged tongue abnormally tall height (if it occurs before puberty)  Growth hormone is produced and released by the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland just below the brain. When growth hormone is released into the blood, it stimulates the liver to produce another hormone \u2013 insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) \u2013 which causes growth of muscle, bones and cartilage throughout the body. This process is essential for growth and repair of body tissues. ","Outlook":"Treatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving problems caused by the condition. Treatment can also increase life expectancy to around that of someone without acromegaly. Some treatments can take a long time to have a noticeable effect and you may need to take medication for a long period of time. After treatment, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor your pituitary function, check you are on the correct hormone replacement treatment, and to ensure the condition does not return. Without treatment, acromegaly can cause long-term problems and may reduce life expectancy by a number of years. ","Problems caused by acromegaly ":"Acromegaly can cause a wide range of symptoms that tend to develop slowly over time. Typical symptoms include: joint pain   large hands and feet carpal tunnel syndrome (compression of the nerve in the wrist, causing numbness and weakness of the hands) thick, coarse, oily skin skin tags enlarged lips, tongue and nose a protruding jaw and brow widely spaced teeth deepening of the voice due to enlarged sinuses and vocal cords obstructive sleep apnoea (breaks in breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the airway) excessive sweating fatigue and weakness headaches impaired vision  loss of sex drive  in women, abnormal periods in men, erectile dysfunction in children and teenagers, excessive height (gigantism) Some of the above symptoms are the result of the tumour compressing nearby tissues \u2013 for example, headaches and vision problems may occur if the tumour squashes nearby nerves. If you think you have acromegaly, see your GP straight away. Acromegaly can usually be successfully treated with brain surgery and medication, but early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent the symptoms getting worse and to reduce your chance of getting complications. If acromegaly is left untreated, you may be at risk of the following health problems: type 2 diabetes  high blood pressure (hypertension) cardiovascular disease cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle) arthritis as a result of overgrowth of bone and cartilage bowel polyps, which can potentially turn into bowel cancer if left untreated Left untreated, these complications can become serious and fatal. ","Who is affected":"It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by acromegaly, although it's been estimated that around 4 to 13 in every 100,000 people may have the condition. This means there is likely to be between 2,500 and 8,300 people in the UK with the condition. Acromegaly can affect people of any age, but it is rare in children. The average age at which people are diagnosed is around 40-45. ","Diagnosing acromegaly":"If your doctor suspects acromegaly from your symptoms, they will order blood tests to measure your levels of human growth hormone. Levels of growth hormone naturally vary from minute to minute as it is released from the pituitary gland in spurts. Therefore to accurately diagnose acromegaly, growth hormone needs to be measured under conditions that normally suppress growth hormone secretion. To ensure an accurate result, you may be referred to a hospital doctor for a glucose tolerance test. This involves testing your blood after drinking a solution or drink containing the sugar glucose. In most people, drinking the glucose solution will suppress the release of growth hormone, but in people with acromegaly, the level of growth hormone in the blood will remain elevated. Your doctor will also measure your level of IGF-1, which should increase with the level of growth hormone. An elevated IGF-1 level almost always indicates acromegaly.  You may then have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain to locate and define the size of the pituitary gland tumour causing your acromegaly.  A computerised tomography (CT) scan can be carried out if you are unable to have an MRI scan. ","Treating acromegaly":"Treatment aims to: reduce excess growth hormone to normal levels relieve the pressure the tumour is exerting on the surrounding structures treat any hormone deficiencies improve the symptoms of acromegaly This is usually achieved through surgical removal of the tumour and medication. In most cases, surgery is recommended to remove the adenoma from your pituitary gland. This is effective in most people, although sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed completely. Under a general anaesthetic, the surgeon will make an incision inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the gland. An endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end) and surgical instruments are then passed through the incisions to remove the tumour. Removing the tumour promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding structures and leads to a rapid lowering of growth hormone levels. Facial appearance and swelling often improve within a few days. Possible complications of surgery include damage to the healthy parts of the pituitary gland, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects the brain), and  meningitis, though this is rare. Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have. The following medications may be used after surgery, or when surgery is not possible: Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline \u2013 these are taken by mouth (orally) once or twice a week and can suppress growth hormone production, although they only work in a small proportion of people. Somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide or lanreotide \u2013 these are generally given by an injection into the muscle or under the skin once a month. They can control growth hormone release and lead to tumour shrinkage in some people. Pegvisomant \u2013 this is given once a day by injection and it directly blocks the effects of growth hormone and can improve symptoms. It lowers IGF-1 but not growth hormone levels. Each of these medications has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you and the benefits and risks of each option. Radiotherapy If surgery is not possible, or surgery and medication do not cure the condition, radiotherapy aimed at the adenoma may be an option. This can eventually lead to a reduction in growth hormone levels, although it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medication in the meantime. There are two main types of radiotherapy for acromegaly: Stereotactic radiosurgery \u2013 where a high-dose beam of radiation is precisely aimed at the tumour, requiring you to wear a rigid head frame to keep your head still. This can sometimes be done in a single session. Conventional radiotherapy \u2013 where the tumour is targeted with external beams. This can potentially damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so small doses of radiation are given over four to six weeks, giving normal tissue time to heal in between treatments. Stereotactic radiosurgery is generally preferred to conventional radiotherapy because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue, although it is not always widely available. Radiotherapy can have a number of side effects. For example, the treatment will often cause a gradual decline in the production of other hormones from your pituitary gland, so you'll usually need to take hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. There's also a risk it will impair fertility. Speak to your doctor about the risks involved. There is some evidence acromegaly may increase your risk of bowel cancer, so guidelines recommend having a colonoscopy when you are diagnosed with the condition, and regular colonoscopy screening from the age of 40. A colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a type of endoscope called a colonoscope that is inserted into your bottom. See bowel cancer tests for more information about what a colonoscopy involves.

This usually occurs as the result of a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour in the pituitary gland called an adenoma, but rare cases have been linked to tumours elsewhere in the body, such as in the lungs and pancreas. Although acromegaly does very occasionally run in families, most adenomas are not inherited \u2013 they usually develop spontaneously as a result of a genetic change within a cell of the pituitary gland. This genetic change switches on a signal that tells cells in the pituitary gland to divide and secrete growth hormone. The tumour almost never spreads to other parts of the body, but it may grow to more than 1cm in size and compress the surrounding nerves and normal pituitary tissue, which can affect the production of other hormones, such as thyroid hormones released from the thyroid gland. "},"Title":"Acromegaly"},"Absent periods":{"Introduction":{" ":"There are many reasons why a woman may miss her usual monthly period, or why periods might stop altogether. Most women have a period every 28 days or so, but it's common to have a slightly shorter or longer cycle than this (from 24 to 35 days). Some women don't always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time. Read more about irregular periods and heavy periods. This page covers: Why your periods might stop When to see your GP There are a number of reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are: pregnancy  stress  sudden weight loss  being overweight or obese extreme overexercising  taking the contraceptive pill reaching the menopause  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a long-term medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature ovarian failure. ","Pregnancy":"You might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails. It might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it doesn't arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant. It's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress. ","Sudden weight loss":"Excessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, where you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. The dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely. If your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, you'll be referred to a psychiatrist. ","Referral to a specialist":"If your GP thinks an underlying medical condition might have caused your periods to stop, they may refer you to a specialist. Depending on what your GP suspects is causing the problem, you may be referred to: a gynaecologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the female reproductive system an endocrinologist \u2013 a specialist in treating hormonal conditions You may have a full gynaecological examination and various tests, including: blood tests \u2013 to see whether you have abnormal levels of certain hormones, such as prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinising hormone an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan \u2013 to identify any problems with your reproductive system or the pituitary gland in your brain  ","Being overweight or obese":"Being overweight or obese can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women. The excess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight or obese, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely. ","Treating underlying conditions":"If test results indicate an underlying medical condition has caused your periods to stop, you may be offered treatment for your condition. For example, if the cause is PCOS, you may be advised to take the contraceptive pill or tablets containing a hormone called progesterone. Read more about the treatment of PCOS. If the cause is early menopause (premature ovarian failure), this means the ovaries no longer function normally. Hormone medication is usually recommended. Treatments to try include the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Read about Johanna's experience of premature ovarian failure. If you have an overactive thyroid gland, you may be given medication to stop your thyroid gland producing too many hormones.  Read more about treating an overactive thyroid gland. Page last reviewed: 28/07/2016 Next review due: 28/07/2019 ","Menopause":"You may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels will start to decrease, and ovulation will become less regular. After the menopause, your periods will stop completely. The menopause is a natural part of the ageing process in women, which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure. ","Contraceptive pill":"You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This isn't usually a cause for concern. Some types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill, contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether. However, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception. ","URL":"/conditions/periods-absent","Stress":"If you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful. Try to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help. If you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act. ","Extreme overexercising":"The stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating. You'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop. If you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods. ","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)":"Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation doesn't take place. PCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK. The condition is responsible for as many as one in three cases of stopped periods. See your GP if you're not pregnant \u2013 you've had a negative pregnancy test \u2013 and you've missed more than three periods in a row. If you're sexually active and you haven't taken a pregnancy test, your GP may advise you to take one. They may also ask you about: your medical history your family's medical history your sexual history any emotional issues you're having any recent changes in your body weight the amount of exercise you do Your GP may recommend waiting to see whether your periods return on their own. In some cases you may need treatment for your periods to return. You should also see your GP if your periods stop before you're 45 or you're still bleeding when you're over 55. "},"Title":"Stopped or missed periods"},"Anaemia, iron deficiency":{"Treatment":{"Treating the underlying cause":"Your GP will also need to ensure the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so it doesn't happen again. For example, if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your GP may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding. Heavy periods can be treated with medication or \u2013 in particularly severe cases \u2013 surgery. Read more about treating heavy periods.  ","Treating iron deficiency anaemia ":"Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause. ","Iron supplements":"Your GP will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, which is taken as a tablet, usually twice a day. Some people can experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including: abdominal (tummy) pain  constipation or diarrhoea heartburn feeling sick black stools (faeces) These side effects should settle down over time. However, your GP may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects. Your GP may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you're finding side effects difficult to cope with.  If you can't take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate. This supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. However, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored. In a few cases \u2013 for example, if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD) \u2013 iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets. As with all medications, it's important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal. ","Dietary advice":"If a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you how to up your intake. Iron-rich foods include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice  pulses and beans  nuts and seeds white and red meat  fish  tofu eggs  dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins Your diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it's healthy and balanced. In particular, food and drink containing vitamin C are important as vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. However, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain medicines, may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include: tea and coffee calcium \u2013 found in dairy products, such as milk  antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \u2013 medications used to relieve indigestion wholegrain cereals \u2013 although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pills You may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you're finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. They'll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can improve your diet. ","URL":"/conditions/Anaemia-iron-deficiency-","Monitoring":"Your GP will ask you to return two to four weeks after you've started taking iron supplements to check how well you've responded to the treatment. You'll have a blood test to check your haemoglobin levels. If your blood test results show an improvement, you'll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four months for another blood test. Once your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your GP will usually recommend continuing to take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body. After this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. Your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later. Sometimes after a person's iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again. This could happen if you don't get enough iron in your diet, you're pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods. In such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. This will usually be a tablet, which you'll have to take once a day.  If your iron levels don't improve, your GP will ask how regularly you've been taking your iron supplements. Some people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. However, your condition won't improve if you don't take the supplements. If you've been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven't improved, your GP may refer you to a specialist for an assessment.

Severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure. Pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth. Read more about the complications of iron deficiency anaemia. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia":"Many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops. You may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer. The most common symptoms include: tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy) shortness of breath  noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations) a pale complexion Less common symptoms include: headache  hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus) an altered sense of taste feeling itchy a sore or abnormally smooth tongue hair loss a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica) difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth spoon-shaped nails See your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple blood test. Read more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia. ","Introduction ":"Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells. Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type. Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body \u2013 read more about vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia. ","How iron deficiency anaemia is treated":"Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes long-term problems. You'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal. The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended. Good sources of iron include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice  pulses and beans nuts and seeds meat, fish and tofu eggs dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins Read more about treating iron deficiency anaemia. ","What causes iron deficiency anaemia?":"There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines. This can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer, bowel cancer, or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In women of reproductive age, heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy. Unless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above. Read more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia. ","URL":"/conditions/Anaemia-iron-deficiency-"},"Causes":{"Pregnancy":"It's also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy. This is because your body needs extra iron to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients.  Some pregnant women require an iron supplement, while others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet. Read more about vitamins and nutrition in pregnancy. ","Causes of iron deficiency anaemia ":"Iron deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. A lack of iron can be caused by several factors. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are outlined below. ","Gastrointestinal blood loss":"The gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. It contains the stomach and intestines. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who've experienced the menopause (when monthly periods stop). Most people with gastrointestinal bleeding don't notice any obvious blood in their stools and don't experience any changes in their bowel habits. Some causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are described below. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause bleeding in the stomach. Ibuprofen and aspirin are two commonly prescribed NSAIDs. If your GP thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. However, don't stop taking a medicine you've been prescribed unless your GP advises you to. The acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. When this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). This is also known as a stomach ulcer or a peptic ulcer. Stomach ulcers can cause the stomach lining to bleed, which can lead to anaemia. In some cases, the bleeding can cause you to vomit blood or pass blood in your stools. However, if the ulcer bleeds slowly, you may not have any symptoms. In a few cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usually stomach cancer or bowel cancer. When trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your GP will check for possible signs of cancer. If your GP suspects cancer, you'll be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in treating digestive conditions) for a more thorough examination. This means that if cancer is found, it can be treated as quickly as possible. If you're 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP should refer you to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. Your  appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your GP referring you. Gastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. This is the result of abnormal, fragile superficial blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding. ","Other causes":"Other conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include: inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in the digestive system, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis  oesophagitis \u2013 inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus) caused by stomach acid leaking through it schistosomiasis \u2013 an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa blood donation \u2013 donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia trauma \u2013 a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood  nosebleeds \u2013 having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although this is rare haematuria (blood in your urine) \u2013 but this rarely causes anaemia and may be a symptom of another condition Malabsorption is when your body can't absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This may happen if you have coeliac disease, a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy). Unless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet. However, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above. Some studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet. If you are vegetarian or vegan, it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as: beans nuts dried fruit, such as dried apricots wholegrains, such as brown rice fortified breakfast cereals soybean flour most dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale If you're pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia. Read more about vegetarian and vegan diets and good sources of iron. Page last reviewed: 14/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019 ","Chronic kidney disease":"People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often develop iron deficiency anaemia. Most people with CKD who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets may be tried first. You can read more about treating anaemia in people with CKD on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. ","Monthly periods":"In women of reproductive age, periods are the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. Usually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. If you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it's known as menorrhagia. ","URL":"/conditions/Anaemia-iron-deficiency-"},"Title":"Iron deficiency anaemia","Diagnosis":{"Finding the cause":"To determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your GP may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. For example, they may ask you about: your diet \u2013 to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods any medicines you take \u2013 to see if you've been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such as ibuprofen or aspirin your menstrual pattern \u2013 if you're a woman, your GP may ask if you've been experiencing particularly heavy periods your family history \u2013 you'll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disorders blood donation \u2013 your GP may ask if you regularly donate blood other medical conditions \u2013 your GP may ask if you've recently had another illness or experienced other symptoms, such as weight loss Iron deficiency anaemia is common during pregnancy. If you're pregnant, your GP will usually only look for an alternative cause if a blood test has identified a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your symptoms or medical history suggest your anaemia may be caused by something else. ","Referral to a specialist":"In some cases, your GP may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in treating digestive conditions. They'll carry out a more thorough examination. For example, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist if your GP can't identify a cause and you have a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your GP thinks there's a possibility your symptoms could be caused by stomach cancer or bowel cancer, although this is unlikely. If you're a woman with heavy periods, you may be referred to a gynaecologist if you don't respond to treatment with iron supplements.

A simple blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis. Your GP may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia. ","Blood test":"To diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count is made. This means all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured. If you have anaemia: your levels of haemoglobin \u2013 a substance that transports oxygen \u2013 will be lower than normal you'll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal your red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual Your GP may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. If your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn't much iron stored in your body and you may have iron deficiency anaemia. Read more about blood tests and a red blood cell count. If your GP thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. Folate works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia is more common in people who are over the age of 75. ","URL":"/conditions/Anaemia-iron-deficiency-","Physical examination":"A physical examination will usually only be needed if the cause of your iron anaemia deficiency hasn't been identified by examining your medical history and asking you about your symptoms. In such cases, your GP may: examine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding look for signs of heart failure, such as swollen ankles \u2013 heart failure can have some similar symptoms to iron deficiency anaemia Two other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below. A rectal examination is usually only needed if you're bleeding from your bottom. It's a common procedure that can help your GP find out if there's something in your gastrointestinal tract that's causing bleeding. Your GP will insert a lubricated gloved finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities. A rectal examination isn't something to be embarrassed about, as it's a procedure your GP will be used to doing. It shouldn't cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort \u2013 this will only last for a minute. Women may have a pelvic examination if their GP thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia. During a pelvic examination, your GP will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection. They may also examine you internally. This will involve your GP inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your womb (uterus) is tender or enlarged. A pelvic examination won't be carried out without your consent (permission), and you can choose to have someone with you. "}},"Angina":{"Prevention":{"Stopping smoking":"Smoking can significantly increase your risk of both heart attacks and strokes, as it causes your arteries to narrow and raises your blood pressure.

If you already have angina, making lifestyle changes also helps prevent your symptoms getting worse and reduces your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The best way to achieve this is to eat a healthy, balanced diet, try to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level, and avoid smoking. This will lower your blood pressure, reduce your cholesterol levels and strengthen your heart. ","Healthy diet":"An unhealthy diet high in saturated fat and salt increases your risk of developing angina, and increases your risk of a heart attack or stroke. A diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables and lots of fibre, such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta, can help reduce this risk.

"},"Treatment":{"Preventing angina attacks":"Medication is also used to prevent angina attacks. This usually involves taking at least one type of medicine every day for the rest of your life. Your GP or cardiologist (an expert in treating heart conditions) will usually try one medication first to see if it helps to prevent your symptoms (monotherapy). If this isn't effective, two medications may be recommended (combination therapy). First, a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker is used to reduce the frequency of angina attacks. Which medication is prescribed may depend on your level of health and, in some cases, your personal preference. Beta-blockers make the heart beat slower and with less force. This means the heart needs less blood and oxygen after exercise, which can either prevent angina or lower its frequency. Common side effects of beta-blockers include tiredness, cold hands and feet, diarrhoea and feeling sick. Beta-blockers can also interact with other medicines, causing adverse side effects. Check with your GP or pharmacist before taking other medicines in combination with beta-blockers, including those available over the counter. Calcium channel blockers work by relaxing the muscles that make up the walls of your arteries, increasing blood supply to the heart. Side effects of calcium channel blockers include flushed face, headaches, dizziness, tiredness and skin rashes. However, these side effects should pass within a few days once your body gets used to the medicine. You should never drink grapefruit juice if you're taking calcium channel blockers, because they can cause a drop in your blood pressure. If you're unable to take beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for medical reasons, or if you find the side effects too unpleasant, your GP or cardiologist may recommend alternative medication. Long-acting nitrates are similar to glyceryl trinitrate, except they're designed for the long-term prevention of symptoms. Side effects include headache and a flushed face, although these should improve with time. If you're taking long-acting nitrates, you shouldn't take sildenafil (Viagra). This is because the combination of the two can lead to a dangerous drop in blood pressure. Ivabradine is a newer type of medication that has a similar effect to beta-blockers in that it slows down the speed of your heart beat. However, it works in a different way to beta-blockers, which means it can often be used in people unable to take beta-blockers for medical reasons, such as those with a lung infection. A common side effect of ivabradine is that people experience temporary flashes of brightness in their field of vision. If you have this side-effect, it may not be safe for you to drive at night. You should ask your GP for advice. Nicorandil is a potassium channel activator that widens the coronary arteries to increase blood flow to the heart. Potassium channel activators can often be used by people who are unable to take calcium channel blockers for medical reasons. Side effects of nicorandil include dizziness, headaches and feeling sick. Ranolazine works by relaxing the muscles of the heart to improve blood flow and prevent angina attacks. Unlike the other medications used to prevent angina attacks, ranolazine doesn't affect the speed at which the heart beats, so it may be a more suitable alternative treatment for people with heart failure or an abnormal heart rhythm. Common side effects of ranolazine include constipation, dizziness and feeling weak. If a single medication doesn't work for you, a combination of medications will probably be recommended. This is known as combination therapy. If combination therapy doesn't work, you may be referred for surgical treatment (see below). In some cases, where people are unable or unwilling to have surgery, or you are waiting for surgery, three different medications may be prescribed.  ","Surgery":"Surgery is usually recommended if your angina symptoms fail to respond to medication. However, you'll probably need to continue taking some medication after having surgery. The two main types of surgery used to treat angina are: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) \u2013 where a section of blood vessel is taken from another part of the body and used to re-route the flow of blood past a blocked or narrow section of artery percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \u2013 where a narrowed section of artery is widened using a tiny tube called a stent In some circumstances it may not be possible to choose whether you have CABG or PCI. For example, PCI may not be suitable for people whose blood vessels have an unusual structure. Both PCI and CAGB are broadly similar in their effectiveness in treating angina and preventing fatal complications in the long term, although each technique has its own set of pros and cons. PCI doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, so the recovery time from surgery is much quicker and there's much less pain afterwards. However, one main disadvantage of PCI is that there's a higher risk of the unblocked section of artery becoming blocked again, which would require further surgery to treat. The most recent data shows that further surgery is required in around 1 in 25 cases. CABG is usually the preferred surgical option for people who: have diabetes, and/or are over 65 years of age, and/or have blockages in three or more of the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood Research indicates that using CABG in such circumstances is more likely to prolong lifespan than using angioplasty. There's also recent evidence that people who have had a CABG usually report a slightly better quality of life in the long term. The disadvantage of CABG is that it causes more post-operative pain than PCI and it has a longer recovery time (usually around 12 weeks, compared to about one to two weeks for PCI). ","Unstable angina":"If you have unstable angina (where symptoms develop unpredictably and persist even when resting), you'll immediately be given medication to prevent blood clots developing and reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. This will usually be aspirin to help thin your blood, unless there's a reason you're unable to take it, such as having a history of liver disease. You'll probably also be prescribed another blood-thinning medication called clopidogrel, which you may need to take for at least 12 months (if you're unable to take aspirin, you'll just be prescribed clopidogrel). You may also be given an injection of an additional blood thinning medication, such as fondaparinux or heparin. It's likely you'll then have a series of tests to assess your risk of having a heart attack in the future (see diagnosing angina for more information). If the risk is moderately high, an examination called a coronary angiography may be carried out to assess the size and location of the blockage in your coronary artery. If the blockage is significant, CABG or PCI can be performed. Page last reviewed: 29/04/2015 Next review due: 29/04/2018 ","Treating angina ":"Treatment of angina aims to provide immediate relief from the symptoms, prevent future attacks, and reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. If your risk is thought to be high, a combination of surgery and medication will probably be recommended. Surgery may also be recommended if medication doesn't work. If your risk of having a heart attack or stroke is thought to be low, it should be possible to significantly reduce the risk by using a combination of medication and lifestyle changes (see preventing angina for more about lifestyle changes). The various treatments for angina are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for angina, allowing you to compare your treatment options. ","If treatment is ineffective":"If the symptoms of angina don't improve despite medication and surgery (or if surgery is unsuitable), a different approach may be used. This may involve the use of psychological or behavioural treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Treatments such as CBT can help you develop skills to cope with your condition, manage your pain and improve your symptoms. There are some treatments that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says shouldn't be offered to help manage pain in people with stable angina: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small, battery-operated machine is used to deliver electrical impulses into the body to relieve pain. Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) \u2013 where inflatable cuffs wrapped around the calves, thighs and buttocks are inflated in time with the rhythm of your heart. This is done to help improve blood flow into and out of your heart. Acupuncture \u2013 a form of ancient Chinese medicine, in which fine needles are inserted into the skin at certain points on the body. These treatments aren't recommended, because there's a lack of evidence concerning their effectiveness and safety for people with stable angina. ","Immediate relief from symptoms":"Glyceryl trinitrate is a medication widely used to provide immediate relief from symptoms of angina. It can also be used as a preventative measure before doing activities known to trigger angina, such as exercise. Glyceryl trinitrate belongs to a group of medication called nitrates. Nitrates work by relaxing and widening the blood vessels that increase the blood supply to the heart. Glyceryl trinitrate is available in tablet form, which you dissolve under your tongue, or as a spray. You may experience headaches, flushing and dizziness soon after taking glyceryl trinitrate. You should avoid drinking alcohol while taking glyceryl trinitrate, because it can make the side effects worse. If you experience dizziness, avoid driving and operating complex or heavy machinery. One dose of glyceryl trinitrate usually eases the pain within two to three minutes. If the first dose does not work, a second dose can be taken after five minutes. You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if the pain continues for five minutes after taking a second dose of glyceryl trinitrate. Glyceryl trinitrate tablets usually expire after about eight weeks, at which point you will need a new supply. Therefore, you may prefer to use glyceryl trinitrate spray, as it lasts for longer. ","Reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke":"Three medications are available to help reduce the risk of a heart attack and stroke in people with angina. They are: Statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver used to make cholesterol. Reducing blood cholesterol levels should prevent further damage to your coronary arteries and should reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke occurring. Statins sometimes have mild side effects that can include constipation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Low-dose aspirin is a type of medication called an antiplatelet. It's used to reduce the \"stickiness\" of your blood to prevent blood clots, which can reduce your risk of having a heart attack. Side effects of low-dose aspirin are uncommon, but can include irritation of the stomach or bowel, indigestion and feeling sick. If you're allergic to aspirin, or you're unable to take it because of another health condition that may be aggravated by it, such as a stomach ulcer, alternative antiplatelet medicines are available. ACE inhibitors are medicines that can be used to reduce your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors block the activity of a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels. As well as stopping the heart working so hard, ACE inhibitors improve the blood flow around the body. ACE inhibitors have been known to reduce the supply of blood to the kidneys, which can reduce their efficiency. Therefore, blood and urine tests may be carried out before you start taking ACE inhibitors to make sure there are no pre-existing problems with your kidneys. Annual blood and urine tests may also be required if you continue to use ACE inhibitors. Side effects of ACE inhibitors include dizziness, tiredness or weakness and a persistent, dry cough, although these should pass within a few days. You should check with your GP or pharmacist before taking any other medication in combination with ACE inhibitors. ","URL":"/conditions/Angina"},"Introduction":{"Who's affected by angina":"Angina is a common condition among older adults. In England, it's estimated that 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 30 women between 55 and 64 years of age have angina. This figure rises to 1 in every 7 men and 1 in every 12 women who are over 65 years of age. Angina is more common in men than women.  Page last reviewed: 29/04/2015 Next review due: 29/04/2018 ","Types of angina":"The two main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina. stable angina \u2013 where angina attacks are brought on by an obvious trigger (such as exercise) and improve with medication and rest unstable angina \u2013 where angina attacks are more unpredictable, occurring with no obvious trigger and continuing despite resting Stable angina isn't life-threatening on its own. However, it's a serious warning sign that you're at increased risk of developing a life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Some people develop unstable angina after previously having stable angina, while others experience unstable angina with no history of having angina before. Unstable angina should be regarded as a medical emergency, because it's a sign that the function of your heart has suddenly and rapidly deteriorated, increasing your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Read more about diagnosing angina. ","Introduction ":"Angina is chest pain that occurs when the blood supply to the muscles of the heart is restricted. It usually happens because the arteries supplying the heart become hardened and narrowed. The pain and discomfort of angina feels like a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can sometimes spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. The pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress and typically only lasts for a few minutes. This is often referred to as an angina attack. Read more about the symptoms of angina. ","Complications":"A major concern for people with angina is that their atherosclerosis will continue to get worse. This can lead to the blood supply to their heart becoming blocked, which could trigger a heart attack. Similarly, a blockage of the blood supply to the brain could trigger a stroke. Each year it's estimated that 1 in every 100 people with stable angina will have a fatal heart attack or stroke, and as many as 1 in 40 people will have a non-fatal heart attack or stroke. You can considerably reduce your risk of developing these complications by making lifestyle changes. For example, if you're obese and you smoke, you can significantly reduce your risk by stopping smoking and maintaining a healthy weight. Read more about the complications of angina and preventing angina. ","Treating angina":"Treatment for angina aims to relieve the symptoms during an angina attack, reduce the number of angina attacks that a person has, and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke happening. A number of medications can be used to try to achieve this. Some of these are only taken when needed, while others are taken every day. Surgery to widen or bypass the narrowed arteries may be recommended if the symptoms don't respond to medication. Read more about treating angina. ","When to seek medical help":"Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you experience chest pain and you haven't previously been diagnosed with a heart problem. If you have an angina attack and you've previously been diagnosed with the condition, take the medication prescribed for you (glyceryl trinitrate). A second dose can be taken after five minutes if the first dose doesn't have any effect. If there's no improvement five minutes after the second dose, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. ","Why angina happens":"Most cases of angina are caused by atherosclerosis, which is the hardening and narrowing of arteries as a result of a build-up of fatty substances known as plaques. This can restrict the blood supply to the heart and trigger the symptoms of angina. Advanced age, smoking, obesity and eating a diet high in saturated fats all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis. Read more about the causes of angina. ","URL":"/conditions/Angina"},"Complications":{"Stroke":"If you have fatty plaques clogging up the arteries to your heart, you may also have plaques clogging up the main blood vessel that supplies your brain with blood (the carotid artery). If one of the plaques ruptures, it could cause a blood clot to develop, blocking the supply of blood to your brain and triggering a stroke. As with a heart attack, you can reduce your risk of having a stroke by making lifestyle changes. The main symptoms of a stroke can be remembered using the word FAST, which stands for Face-Arms-Speech-Time. Face \u2013 the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have drooped Arms \u2013 the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift one or both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness Speech \u2013 the person\u2019s speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake Time \u2013 it's time to dial 999 immediately if you notice any of these signs or symptoms A stroke can be treated using medication to dissolve the blood clot, and surgery to unblock the carotid artery. ","Complications of angina ":"Heart attacks and strokes are the most serious complications of angina. The stress of living with a long-term condition can also have an impact on your emotional health. ","Stress, anxiety and depression":"Living with a condition such as angina can cause feelings of stress and anxiety in some people, which can lead to symptoms of depression. You may be feeling depressed if, during the last month: you have often felt down, depressed or hopeless you have little interest or pleasure in doing things It's important to speak to your GP if you think you're depressed. Depression doesn't only affect your mental health, it can also have an adverse affect on your physical health as well. Treatments for depression include antidepressant medications and a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Page last reviewed: 29/04/2015 Next review due: 29/04/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Angina","Heart attack":"Most cases of angina are caused by fatty deposits (plaques) building up on the inside walls of the blood vessels leading to the heart. There's a small chance one of the plaques will break away, causing a blood clot to form. The blood clot can then block the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the muscles of the heart, causing extensive damage to the heart muscles and triggering a heart attack. The risk of having a heart attack depends on a number of things, such as age, blood pressure and the extent of the blockage. Depending on these factors, the risk of having a heart attack in any given year can range from less than 1 in 100 to 1 in 12. It's always possible to lower this risk by making lifestyle changes (see preventing angina for more information). Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain \u2013 the pain is usually in the centre of your chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of your body \u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from your chest to your arm (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and abdomen shortness of breath  nausea  an overwhelming sense of anxiety (similar to having a panic attack) You should dial 999 immediately if you suspect a heart attack. Heart attacks are treated using a combination of medication to improve the blood flow to the heart and surgery to bypass the blockage (coronary artery bypass graft) or widen the artery (percutaneous coronary intervention). "},"Causes":{"Causes of angina ":"Angina is caused by narrowing and hardening of the main blood vessels going to the heart, which limits blood supply to this major organ. Like all of the body\u2019s organs and tissues, your heart needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to function normally. Blood is supplied to the heart by two large blood vessels known as the coronary arteries. Over time, the walls of these arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by this build-up of fatty substances. When you're resting, the muscles of your heart only need a relatively small supply of blood. However, when you exercise or feel stressed, your heart muscles have to work harder and the demand for blood increases. If the coronary arteries are narrowed, the required amount of blood is unable to reach the heart in time, triggering the symptoms of angina. ","Increased risk":"Anything that causes the coronary arteries to narrow can increase your risk of angina. This can include: high blood pressure a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol lack of exercise smoking type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes age family history These risk factors can often be inter-related. They're explained below in more detail. Your arteries are designed to pump blood at a certain pressure. If that pressure is exceeded, the artery walls may become damaged. High blood pressure can be caused by: being overweight drinking excessive amounts of alcohol smoking stress a lack of exercise For reasons that aren't fully understood, high blood pressure is more common among people of Afro-Caribbean and south Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) origin. A tendency to develop high blood pressure also often runs in families. Read more about preventing high blood pressure. Cholesterol is a type of fat that's essential for the functioning of the body. It helps to produce hormones, protects nerve endings and makes up cell membranes (the walls that protect individual cells). There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 mostly made up of fat, plus a small amount of protein; this type of cholesterol can block your arteries, so is often referred to as \"bad cholesterol\" high-density lipoprotein (HDL) \u2013 mostly made up of protein, plus a small amount of fat; this type of cholesterol can help to reduce a blockage in your arteries, so is often referred to as \"good cholesterol\" Most of the cholesterol the body needs is manufactured by the liver. However, eating foods high in saturated fat increases the levels of bad cholesterol in your blood. Read more about lowering your cholesterol. A lack of regular exercise can raise your blood pressure and increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Both of these increase your risk of developing angina. Smoking can damage the walls of your arteries. If your arteries are damaged by smoking, blood cells called platelets form at the site of the damage in an attempt to repair it. This can cause your arteries to narrow. Smoking also decreases your blood's ability to carry oxygen around your body, which increases the chances of a blood clot occurring. Read more about stopping smoking. If you have poorly controlled diabetes, the excess glucose in your blood can damage the walls of your arteries. As you get older, your risk of developing angina increases, as your arteries are more likely to have narrowed over time. Heart disease can run in families, so if you have a first-degree relative (mother, father, brother or sister) with a history of heart disease or angina, your risk of developing angina is increased. Page last reviewed: 29/04/2015 Next review due: 29/04/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Angina"},"Title":"Angina","Diagnosis":{"Diagnosing angina ":"If you see your GP after experiencing chest pain, they'll probably ask about the pattern of your symptoms \u2013 for example, if you've noticed any particular triggers.   Your GP will then assess whether you're at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis. This is where the arteries become clogged by fatty substances, which can lead to the symptoms of angina. As part of the assessment you'll have: blood pressure tests your weight and waist size measured blood tests to measure the amount of cholesterol and glucose (if you are diabetic) in your blood and also to determine how well your liver is working a urine test to determine how well your kidneys are working Tests are necessary because some angina medications aren't suitable for people with liver or kidney disease. You're also likely to discuss whether you smoke, if you drink and how much, whether you have a high-fat diet, and any family history of heart disease. ","Unstable angina":"If it's thought you may have unstable angina, you'll be admitted to hospital. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may be placed in a general ward or in the coronary care unit (CCU). You'll be given an ECG as soon as you arrive at hospital to quickly assess whether your heart has been significantly damaged. Blood tests will also be carried out to help identify increased enzyme levels (these are released when the heart is damaged). A coronary angiography may also be performed to assess the size and location of the blockage in your coronary artery. Treatment may be started urgently, before all of the test results are known, to prevent serious complications arising from unstable angina. After receiving suitable treatment for unstable angina, doctors will want to assess how likely you are to develop another angina attack, or possibly the symptoms of a heart attack, in the next six months. The outcome will have an important bearing on your recommended treatment plan. GRACE is a widely used method of assessing the risk of further heart problems occurring. GRACE is a scoring system based on factors such as: your age the number of times your heart beats every minute your blood pressure how much of a substance called creatinine is present in your blood \u2013 higher-than-expected levels can be a sign of heart damage whether you have any signs and symptoms of heart failure, such as excess fluid inside your lungs Your GRACE score provides a relatively accurate predictor of your risk of developing further heart problems. The score can range from very low (less than 1 in 65) to the highest (more than 1 in 10). Surgery is usually recommended as a precaution if you have at least a 1 in 33 chance of developing further problems. Read more about treating unstable angina. Page last reviewed: 29/04/2015 Next review due: 29/04/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Angina","Further tests":"If angina is suspected, you'll usually be referred to a specialist cardiology department or clinic for diagnosis and to assess your risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the future. You may be prescribed a medication called glyceryl trinitrate to provide immediate relief for any angina while you wait to see a specialist (see treating angina for more information). The assessment involves a series of tests that are explained below. An ECG records the rhythms and electrical activity of your heart. A number of electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on your arms, legs and chest. The electrodes are connected to a machine that records the electrical signals of each heartbeat. An abnormal ECG reading may indicate that the muscles of your heart aren't receiving enough blood. An ETT is similar to an ECG, but it's carried out when you're exercising, usually on a treadmill or an exercise bike. An ETT can be used to measure how much exercise your heart is able to tolerate before the symptoms of angina are triggered. This information is useful for assessing how severe your angina is likely to be. An MPS is an alternative test to an ETT used if a person is unable to exercise or when the results of an ETT are unclear. MPS involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive substance into your blood. A special camera, known as a gamma camera, is used to track the substance as it moves through your blood vessels and into your heart. This allows healthcare professionals to determine how well blood is reaching your heart. MPS is usually carried out both at rest and when you're exercising. If you're unable to exercise, medication can be used to replicate the effects of exercise on your heart. A coronary angiography is a test to identify whether your coronary arteries are narrowed and determine how severe any blockages are. During an angiography, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is passed into a vein or artery in your groin or arm, and X-rays are used to guide it into your coronary arteries. A dye is injected into the catheter to highlight the arteries supplying blood to your heart. A number of X-ray images (angiograms) are taken, which highlight any blockages. Coronary angiographies carry a small risk of serious complications, such as a stroke or a heart attack, which is estimated to be around 1 in 1,000. Although this risk is small, healthcare professionals are usually unwilling to perform an angiogram unless the benefits of the procedure outweigh potential risks. Therefore, it's likely you'll only be referred for a coronary angiogram if: the diagnosis of angina remains unclear your angina symptoms persist despite treatment and/or you're thought to be at significant risk of having a heart attack or stroke and surgery is being considered "},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms of angina ":"The most common symptom of angina is a feeling of pain or discomfort in your chest. The pain can feel tight, dull or heavy. The pain can spread from your chest to your left arm, neck, jaw and back. In some cases, the pain is similar to indigestion. Chest pain may also occur with: breathlessness  feeling sick (nausea) feeling unusually tired dizziness restlessness Some people may experience breathlessness without any obvious chest pain. ","Triggers":"There are two types of angina, called stable and unstable angina. The symptoms of these two types are similar, but there are some important differences. Attacks of stable angina usually occur when the heart is forced to work harder \u2013 for example, during physical activity or emotional stress. In some cases, the pain can also develop after eating a meal or during cold weather. These are known as angina triggers. The symptoms of stable angina usually improve if you rest for a few minutes. Unstable angina is more unpredictable. It can develop without any obvious triggers and can persist even when you're resting. Attacks of unstable angina may last longer than a few minutes and don't always respond to treatments used for stable angina. ","When to seek medical help":"Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you experience chest pain and you haven't previously been diagnosed with a heart problem. If aspirin is easily available and you're not allergic to it, take one tablet while you are waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Chewable aspirin is best, because it works faster than other forms. Aspirin helps to prevent blood clots and reduces your risk of experiencing a heart attack or a stroke. If you have an angina attack and you've previously been diagnosed with the condition, take the medication prescribed for you (called glyceryl trinitrate). A second dose can be taken after five minutes, if the first dose doesn't have any effect. If there's no improvement five minutes after the second dose, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

But like any medical treatment, there is a small risk that something could go wrong. The risk of complications increases the later in pregnancy an abortion is carried out. This page covers: Possible complications When to get medical advice Effect on fertility and future pregnancies The main risks associated with an abortion are: infection of the womb \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 10 abortions; it can usually be treated with antibiotics some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 20 abortions; further treatment may be required if this happens continuation of the pregnancy \u2013 occurs in less than 1 in every 100 abortions; further treatment will be needed if this happens excessive bleeding \u2013 occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 abortions; severe cases may require a blood transfusion damage of the entrance to the womb (cervix) \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 100 surgical abortions damage to the womb \u2013 occurs in 1 in every 250 to 1,000 surgical abortions and less than 1 in 1,000 medical abortions carried out at 12 to 24 weeks Women who have an abortion are no more likely to experience mental health problems than those who continue with their pregnancy. There is also no link between having an abortion and an increased risk of breast cancer. After having an abortion, you'll probably experience some period-type pains and vaginal bleeding. This should start to gradually improve after a few days, but can last for one to two weeks. It's normal and is usually nothing to worry about. But you should get advice if you experience any signs of a possible problem, such as: excessive bleeding \u2013 for example, if you pass large clots or go through two or more sanitary pads an hour for more than two hours in a row severe pain that can't be controlled with painkillers such as ibuprofen a high temperature (fever) smelly vaginal discharge continuing pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and sore breasts The clinic will provide you with the number of a 24-hour helpline to call if you experience any problems after an abortion. Having an abortion won't affect your chances of becoming pregnant and having normal pregnancies in the future. Many women are able to get pregnant immediately afterwards, so you should start using contraception right away if you don't want this to happen. You should be advised about this at the time you have the abortion. However, there's a very small risk to your fertility and future pregnancies if you develop a womb infection that isn't treated promptly. The infection could spread to your fallopian tubes and ovaries \u2013 known as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can increase the risk of infertility or ectopic pregnancy, where an egg implants itself outside of the womb. But most infections are treated before they reach this stage and you'll often be given antibiotics before an abortion to reduce the risk of infection. Having several abortions is associated with a slightly increased risk of giving birth prematurely, before the 37th week of pregnancy, in future pregnancies. Talk to your doctor or an abortion advice service for more information if you're concerned about the possible risks of an abortion.

It's also sometimes known as a termination. The pregnancy is ended either by taking medications or having a minor surgical procedure. One in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime. This page covers: How to get an abortion When it can be done Making a decision What happens Risks of an abortion Abortions can only be carried out in an NHS hospital or a licensed clinic, and are usually available free of charge on the NHS. There are three main ways to get an abortion on the NHS: contact an abortion provider directly \u2013 the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), Marie Stopes UK and the National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service (NUPAS) can tell you about eligibility and services in your area speak to your GP and ask for a referral to an abortion service \u2013 your GP should refer you to another doctor if he or she has any objections to abortion visit a contraception clinic, family planning clinic, sexual health clinic or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic and ask for a referral to an abortion service Waiting times can vary, but you shouldn't have to wait more than two weeks from your initial appointment to having an abortion. Abortions can also be paid for privately if you prefer. Costs for private abortions vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method used to carry out the procedure. Most abortions in England, Wales and Scotland are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy. They can be carried out after 24 weeks in certain circumstances \u2013 for example, if the mother's life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe disability. The length of your pregnancy is calculated from the first day of your last period. If you're not sure how long you've been pregnant, you may need an ultrasound scan to check. Abortions are simpler and safer the earlier they're carried out. Getting advice early on will give you more time to make a decision if you're unsure. Some women may be certain they want to have an abortion, while others may find it more difficult to make a decision. The decision to have an abortion is yours alone. But all women requesting an abortion should be offered the opportunity to discuss their options and choices with, and receive support from, a trained pregnancy counsellor. Impartial information and support is available from: your GP or another doctor at your GP practice a counselling service at the abortion clinic organisations such as the FPA, Brook (for under-25s), BPAS, Marie Stopes UK and NUPAS \u2013 but beware of so-called \"crisis pregnancy centres\" that claim to provide impartial advice but often do not You may also want to speak to your partner, friends or family, but you don't need to discuss it with anyone else and they don't have a say in the final decision. If you don't want to tell anyone, your details will be kept confidential. If you're under 16, your parents don't usually need to be told. Information about an abortion doesn't go on your medical record.  Before having an abortion, you'll attend an appointment to talk about your decision and what happens next. Whenever possible, you should be given a choice of how you would like the abortion to be carried out. There are two options: medical abortion (the \"abortion pill\") \u2013 you take two medications, usually 24 to 48 hours apart, to induce a miscarriage surgical abortion \u2013 you have a minor procedure to remove the pregnancy and normally go home soon afterwards After an abortion, you'll probably need to take things easy for a few days. It's likely you'll experience some discomfort and vaginal bleeding for up to two weeks. Read more about how an abortion is carried out. Abortions are safest if they're carried out as early as possible in pregnancy. Most women won't experience any problems, but there is a small risk of complications, such as: infection of the womb \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 10 abortions some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 20 abortions excessive bleeding \u2013 occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 abortions damage to the entrance of the womb (cervix) \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 100 surgical abortions damage to the womb \u2013 occurs in 1 in every 250 to 1,000 surgical abortions and less than 1 in 1,000 medical abortions carried out at 12 to 24 weeks If complications do occur, further treatment \u2013 including surgery \u2013 may be required. Having an abortion won't affect your chances of becoming pregnant again and having normal pregnancies in the future. In fact, you may be able to get pregnant immediately afterwards and should use contraception if you want to avoid this. Read more about the risks of abortion.

You won't usually need to stay in the clinic or hospital overnight, but you may need to attend several appointments on different days. This page covers: Before an abortion Methods of abortion Afterwards Before having an abortion, you'll need to attend an assessment appointment at the hospital or clinic. During this assessment, you may: discuss your reasons for considering an abortion and whether you're sure about your decision be offered the chance to talk things over with a trained counsellor if you think it might help talk to a nurse or doctor about the abortion methods available, including any associated risks and complications do a pregnancy test to confirm you're pregnant \u2013 an ultrasound scan may be done to check how many weeks pregnant you are be tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), your blood type and low iron levels (anaemia) be given antibiotics to reduce the risk of an infection developing after the abortion When you're sure you want to go ahead with the abortion, you'll be asked to sign a consent form and a date for the abortion will be arranged. You can change your mind at any point up to the start of the procedure. There are two main types of abortion: medical abortion (the \"abortion pill\") \u2013 taking medication to end the pregnancy surgical abortion \u2013 a minor procedure to remove the pregnancy Medical and surgical abortions can generally only be carried out up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. But in exceptional circumstances an abortion can take place after 24 weeks \u2013 for example, if there's a risk to life or there are problems with the baby's development. You should be offered a choice of which method you would prefer whenever possible. ","URL":"/conditions/Abortion","Medical abortion":"A medical abortion involves taking medication to end the pregnancy. It doesn't require surgery or an anaesthetic, and can be used at any stage of pregnancy. It involves the following steps: you first take a medicine called mifepristone \u2013 this stops the hormone that allows the pregnancy to continue working; you'll be able to go home afterwards and continue your normal activities usually 24 to 48 hours later, you have another appointment where you take a second medicine called misoprostol \u2013 this will either be a tablet that you may swallow, let dissolve under your tongue or between your cheek and gum, or put inside your vagina within four to six hours, the lining of the womb breaks down, causing bleeding and loss of the pregnancy \u2013 you may have to stay at the clinic while this happens or you may be able to go home If a medical abortion is carried out after nine weeks, you may need more doses of misoprostol and you're more likely to need to stay in the clinic or hospital. Occasionally, the pregnancy doesn't pass and a small operation is needed to remove it. ","Surgical abortion":"Surgical abortion involves having a procedure with local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed), conscious sedation (where you're relaxed but awake), or general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). There are two methods. Can be used up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. It involves inserting a tube through the entrance to the womb (the cervix) and into your womb. The pregnancy is then removed using suction. Your cervix will be gently widened (dilated) first. A tablet may be placed inside your vagina or taken by mouth a few hours beforehand to soften your cervix and make it easier to open. Pain relief is usually given using medicines that you take by mouth, and local anaesthetic, which is numbing medicine injected into the cervix. You may also be offered some sedation, which is given by injection. A general anaesthetic isn't usually needed. Vacuum aspiration takes about 5 to 10 minutes and most women go home a few hours later.  Used from around 15 weeks of pregnancy. It involves inserting special instruments called forceps through the cervix and into the womb to remove the pregnancy. The cervix is gently dilated for several hours or up to a day before the surgery to allow the forceps to be inserted. D&E is carried out with conscious sedation or general anaesthetic. It normally takes about 10 to 20 minutes and you might be able to go home the same day. If you have a medical abortion, you may experience shortlived side effects from the medications, such as nausea and diarrhoea. General anaesthetic and conscious sedation medication can also have side effects.  For all types of abortion, it's likely you will experience some stomach cramps and vaginal bleeding, too. These usually last a week or two. Sometimes light vaginal bleeding after a medical abortion can last up to a month. After an abortion, you can: take ibuprofen to help with any pain or discomfort use sanitary towels or pads rather than tampons until the bleeding has stopped have sex as soon as you feel ready, but use contraception if you want to avoid getting pregnant again as you'll usually be fertile immediately after an abortion Get advice if you experience heavy bleeding, severe pain, smelly vaginal discharge, a fever or ongoing signs of pregnancy, such as nausea and sore breasts. The clinic will give you the number of a 24-hour helpline to call if you have concerns. You may experience a range of emotions after an abortion. If you need to discuss how you're feeling, contact the abortion service or ask your GP about post-abortion counselling. You can also find NHS counselling services near you. It's against the law to try to cause your own abortion. It is possible to buy abortion pills online, but you will not know if these are genuine and they could be harmful. Before doing anything, contact an abortion advice service such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), who can help you find appropriate care for free and in confidence.

Signs and symptoms of an air embolism can include: joint or muscle pains low blood pressure, which may cause dizziness  an irregular heartbeat breathlessness and fast breathing blurred vision chest pain strong feelings of anxiety and itching of the skin a faint blue tone to the skin (cyanosis) bloody froth from the mouth paralysis or weakness, possibly of one or more limbs seizures (fits) loss of consciousness If a scuba diver develops these symptoms within 10 to 20 minutes of surfacing, they probably have an air embolism and should be given 100% oxygen and transferred to hospital as soon as possible, preferably one with a recompression chamber. ","Other causes of air embolisms":"Air embolisms also occur during surgery or other medical procedures, but this is rare. In hospitals and health centres, care should be taken to prevent this. For example: before injections, air should be removed from syringes and intravenous lines catheters or other tubes inserted into the body should be inserted and removed using a technique that minimises the possibility of air getting into the blood vessels patients should be closely monitored to help ensure air bubbles don't form in blood vessels during surgery Air embolisms resulting from surgery, anaesthesia or other medical procedures can be difficult to treat. Treatment is usually needed to support the heart, blood vessels and lungs. For example, fluids may be used to treat a fall in blood pressure and oxygen may be given to reduce levels of other gases in the blood vessels. Page last reviewed: 20/05/2015 Next review due: 20/05/2017 ","Introduction ":"An air or gas embolism is a bubble that becomes trapped in a blood vessel and blocks it. This can lead to many different symptoms depending on where the blockage occurs. It's one of the leading causes of death among divers. An air or gas embolism can happen when a scuba diver surfaces too quickly from any depth. This can cause air to escape into the blood vessels from the lungs (pulmonary barotrauma) or bubbles of nitrogen to form in the blood vessels (decompression illness, or \"the bends\"). An embolism can develop in an artery or vein. When an air bubble travels along an artery, it moves through a system of blood vessels that gradually become narrower. At some point, the bubble may block a small artery and cut off the blood supply to a particular area of the body. Bubbles in the veins travel around the body and can cause breathing difficulties when they reach the lungs. ","Treating air embolisms":"If a diver develops an air embolism, the only effective treatment is immediate recompression treatment in a special pressurised room called a hyperbaric chamber. The diver should be given 100% oxygen and laid horizontally until they reach the hyperbaric chamber. Recompression treatment involves lying in a hyperbaric chamber, usually for several hours, and breathing a mixture of gases and oxygen under pressure. The high pressure can restore normal blood flow and oxygen to the body's tissues and reduce the size of the air bubbles in the body. In cases of decompression sickness, the pressure forces the bubbles of nitrogen to dissolve back into the bloodstream. After recompression, pressure is reduced gradually to allow the gases to leave the body without worsening the problem, similar to surfacing slowly from a dive. Treatment might be continued for several days depending on the severity of symptoms. ","Preventing an air embolism while diving":"The following advice can help reduce your risk of developing an air or gas embolism when diving. Limit the depth and duration of your dives. Come up to the surface slowly and always perform safety stops to allow any air in your tissues and blood vessels to escape safely. Use a dive computer or dive tables, and don't dive again if you have broken these rules until you have had a suitable time at the surface. Don't dive with a cold, cough or chest infection. Avoid rigorous exercise before, during and after a dive. Make sure you're well hydrated before diving. If planning several dives, leave adequate surface intervals between dives to allow the nitrogen to leave your body. After diving, wait for 24 hours before flying or going to a higher altitude. If in doubt, contact a dive professional or doctor, who can provide further advice. ","URL":"/conditions/Air-embolism","How serious is it?":"The seriousness of the blockage depends on which part of the body the affected blood vessel supplies blood to and the size of the air bubble. For example, an air embolism in: the arteries to the brain can cause immediate loss of consciousness and may lead to seizures (fits) or a stroke \u2013 it can also cause confusion, dizziness and slurred speech the coronary arteries (which lead to the heart) may cause a heart attack or an abnormal heart rhythm a blood vessel to the lungs may cause a pulmonary embolism These conditions are very serious and can be fatal, particularly if an air embolism is not recognised and treated promptly. Even with treatment, some people who survive are left with permanent brain damage, although this is very rare.

The main things you can do to reduce your risk are outlined below. Finding out if you're allergic to anything that could trigger anaphylaxis can help you avoid these triggers in the future. If you've had anaphylaxis and haven't already been diagnosed with an allergy, you should be referred to an allergy clinic for tests to identify any triggers. The most commonly used tests are: a skin prick test \u2013 your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of a suspected allergen to see if it reacts a blood test \u2013 a sample of your blood is taken to test its reaction to a suspected allergen Read more about diagnosing allergies and allergy testing. If a trigger has been identified, you'll need to take steps to avoid it in the future whenever possible. See below for advice about avoiding some specific triggers. ","Insect stings":"You can reduce your risk of being stung by an insect by taking basic precautions, such as: moving away from wasps, hornets or bees slowly without panicking \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them using an insect repellent if you spend time outdoors, particularly in the summer being careful drinking out of cans when there are insects around \u2013 insects may fly or crawl inside the can and sting you in the mouth when you take a drink not walking around outside with bare feet Some specialist allergy centres can also offer special treatment to help desensitise you to insect stings (immunotherapy). Read more about preventing insect stings. ","Medicines":"If you're allergic to certain types of medicines, there are normally alternatives that can be safely used. For example, if you're allergic to: penicillin \u2013 you can normally safely take a different group of antibiotics known as macrolides non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin \u2013 you can normally safely take paracetamol; read the ingredients of things like colds medicines carefully to make sure they don't contain NSAIDs one type of general anaesthetic \u2013 others are available, or it may be possible to perform surgery using a local anaesthetic or an epidural injection Always tell any healthcare professional about medicine allergies you have, as they may not be aware of them. You may be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector if there's an ongoing risk you could develop anaphylaxis.  There are three types of auto-injector \u2013 EpiPen, Jext and Emerade \u2013 that are each slightly different. Click on the links for advice about how to use these injectors. It's important to remember the following: carry an auto-injector at all times \u2013 there should be no exceptions; you may also be advised to get an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your allergy and doctor's contact details to alert others extremes of heat can make adrenaline less effective \u2013 so don't leave your auto-injector in the fridge or your car's glove compartment, for example check the expiry date regularly \u2013 an out-of-date injector will offer limited protection manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the expiry date \u2013 check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more information don't delay injecting yourself if you think you may be experiencing anaphylaxis, even if your initial symptoms are mild \u2013 it's better to use adrenaline early and then find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you're sure you're experiencing severe anaphylaxis If your child has an auto-injector, they will need to change over to an adult dose once they reach 30kg (approximately 4.5 stone).

People with potentially serious allergies will often be given an adrenaline auto-injector to carry at all times. This can help stop an anaphylactic reaction becoming life threatening. This should be used as soon as a serious reaction is suspected, either by the person experiencing anaphylaxis or someone helping them. If you've been given an auto-injector, make sure you're aware how to use it correctly. There are three main types of adrenaline auto-injector, which are used in slightly different ways.

Someone experiencing anaphylaxis should be placed in a comfortable position. Most people should lie flat. Pregnant women should lie on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart. People having trouble breathing should sit up to help make breathing easier. People who are unconscious should be placed in the recovery position to ensure the airway remains open and clear \u2013 place them on their side, making sure they're supported by one leg and one arm, and open their airway by lifting their chin. Avoid a sudden change to an upright posture such as standing or sitting up \u2013 this can cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure. If the person's breathing or heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed immediately. You will need to go to hospital for observation \u2013 usually for 6-12 hours \u2013 as the symptoms can occasionally return during this period. While in hospital: an oxygen mask may be used to help breathing fluids may be given directly into a vein to help increase blood pressure additional medications such as antihistamines and steroids may be used to help relieve symptoms blood tests may be carried out to confirm anaphylaxis You should be able to go home when the symptoms are under control and it's thought they won't return quickly. This will usually be after a few hours, but may be longer if the reaction was severe. You may be asked to take antihistamine and steroid tablets for a few days after leaving hospital to help stop your symptoms returning. You will also probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment with an allergy specialist so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.

But this isn't always easy. Allergens, such as dust mites, aren't always easy to spot and can breed in even the cleanest house. It can also be difficult to avoid coming into contact with pets, particularly if they belong to friends and family. Below is some advice to help you avoid the most common allergens. Dust mites are one of the biggest causes of allergies. They're microscopic insects that breed in household dust. To help limit the number of mites in your house, you should: consider buying an air-permeable occlusive mattress and bedding covers \u2013 this type of bedding acts as a barrier to dust mites and their droppings choose wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of carpet fit roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean regularly clean cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture, either by washing or vacuuming them use synthetic pillows and acrylic duvets instead of woollen blankets or feather bedding use a vacuum cleaner fitted with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter \u2013 it can remove more dust than ordinary vacuum cleaners use a clean damp cloth to wipe surfaces \u2013 dry dusting can spread allergens further Concentrate your efforts on controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend most time, such as the bedroom and living room. It isn't pet fur that causes an allergic reaction, but exposure to flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine. If you can't permanently remove a pet from the house, you may find the following tips useful: keep pets outside as much as possible or limit them to one room, preferably one without carpet don't allow pets in bedrooms wash pets at least once a fortnight groom dogs regularly outside regularly wash bedding and soft furnishings your pet has been on If you're visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you're visiting because it will disturb allergens into the air. Taking an antihistamine medicine one hour before you enter a house with a pet can help reduce your symptoms. Different plants and trees pollinate at different times of the year, so when you get allergic rhinitis will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you're allergic to. Most people are affected during the spring and summer months because this is when most trees and plants pollinate. To avoid exposure to pollen, you may find the following tips useful: check weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it's high avoid line-drying clothes and bedding when the pollen count is high wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen keep doors and windows shut during mid-morning and early evening, when there's most pollen in the air shower, wash your hair and change your clothes after being outside avoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields, when possible  if you have a lawn, consider asking someone else to cut the grass for you  Moulds can grow on any decaying matter, both in and outside the house. The moulds themselves aren't allergens, but the spores they release are. Spores are released when there's a sudden rise in temperature in a moist environment, such as when central heating is turned on in a damp house or wet clothes are dried next to a fireplace. To help prevent mould spores, you should: keep your home dry and well ventilated when showering or cooking, open windows but keep internal doors closed to prevent damp air spreading through the house, and use extractor fans avoid drying clothes indoors, storing clothes in damp cupboards and packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes deal with any damp and condensation in your home Read more about how damp and mould can affect your health and how to get rid of damp and mould.

You can do this either by using a homemade solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy. Small syringes or pots that often look like small horns or teapots are also available to help flush the solution around the inside of your nose. To make the solution at home, mix half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda (baking powder) into a pint (568ml) of boiled water that's been left to cool to around body temperature \u2013 do not attempt to rinse your nose while the water is still hot. To rinse your nose: stand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it sniff the water into one nostril at a time repeat this until your nose feels comfortable \u2013 you may not need to use all of the solution While you do this, some solution may pass into your throat through the back of your nose. The solution is harmless if swallowed, but try to spit out as much of it as possible. Nasal irrigation can be carried out as often as necessary, but a fresh solution should be made each time. Medication won't cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the common symptoms. If your symptoms are caused by seasonal allergens, such as pollen, you should be able to stop taking your medication after the risk of exposure has passed. Visit your GP if your symptoms don't respond to medication after two weeks. ","Antihistamines":"Antihistamines relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis by blocking the action of a chemical called histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen. You can buy antihistamine tablets over the counter from your pharmacist without a prescription, but antihistamine nasal sprays are only available with a prescription. Antihistamines can sometimes cause drowsiness. If you're taking them for the first time, see how you react to them before driving or operating heavy machinery. In particular, antihistamines can cause drowsiness if you drink alcohol while taking them. ","Corticosteroids":"If you have frequent or persistent symptoms and you have a nasal blockage or nasal polyps, your GP may recommend a nasal spray or drops containing corticosteroids. Corticosteroids help reduce inflammation and swelling. They take longer to work than antihistamines, but their effects last longer. Side effects from inhaled corticosteroids are rare, but can include nasal dryness, irritation and nosebleeds. If you have a particularly severe bout of symptoms and need rapid relief, your GP may prescribe a short course of corticosteroid tablets lasting 5 to 10 days. ","Treating allergic rhinitis ":"Treatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are and how much they're affecting your everyday activities. In most cases treatment aims to relieve symptoms such as sneezing and a blocked or runny nose. If you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.  You should visit your GP if your symptoms are more severe and affecting your quality of life, or if self-help measures haven't been effective. It's possible to treat the symptoms of mild allergic rhinitis with over-the-counter medications, such as long-acting, non-sedating antihistamines. If possible, try to reduce exposure to the allergen that triggers the condition. See preventing allergic rhinitis for more information and advice about this. ","URL":"/conditions/rhinitis---allergic","Add-on treatments":"If allergic rhinitis doesn't respond to treatment, your GP may choose to add to your original treatment.  They may suggest: increasing the dose of your corticosteroid nasal spray using a short-term course of a decongestant nasal spray to take with your other medication combining antihistamine tablets with corticosteroid nasal sprays, and possibly decongestants using a nasal spray that contains a medicine called ipratropium, which will help reduce excessive nasal discharge using a leukotriene receptor antagonist medication \u2013 medication that blocks the effects of chemicals called leukotrienes, which are released during an allergic reaction If you don't respond to the add-on treatments, you may be referred to a specialist for further assessment and treatment. Immunotherapy, also known as hyposensitisation or desensitisation, is another type of treatment used for some allergies. It's only suitable for people with certain types of allergies, such as hay fever, and is usually only considered if your symptoms are severe. Immunotherapy involves gradually introducing more and more of the allergen into your body to make your immune system less sensitive to it. The allergen is often injected under the skin of your upper arm. Injections are given at weekly intervals, with a slightly increased dose each time. Immunotherapy can also be carried out using tablets that contain an allergen, such as grass pollen, which are placed under your tongue. When a dose is reached that's effective in reducing your allergic reaction (the maintenance dose), you'll need to continue with the injections or tablets for up to three years. Immunotherapy should only be carried out under the close supervision of a specially trained doctor as there's a risk it may cause a serious allergic reaction.

It's a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people in the UK. Allergic rhinitis typically causes cold-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen. Some people only get allergic rhinitis for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely. Visit your GP if the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are disrupting your sleep, preventing you carrying out everyday activities, or adversely affecting your performance at work or school. A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis will usually be based on your symptoms and any possible triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for allergy testing. Read more about diagnosing allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is caused by the immune system reacting to an allergen as if it were harmful. This results in cells releasing a number of chemicals that cause the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become swollen and excessive levels of mucus to be produced. Common allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include pollen \u2013 this type of allergic rhinitis is known as hay fever \u2013 as well as mould spores, house dust mites, and flakes of skin or droplets of urine or saliva from certain animals. Read more about the causes of allergic rhinitis. It's difficult to completely avoid potential allergens, but you can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis. This will help improve your symptoms. If your condition is mild, you can also help reduce the symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications, such as non-sedating antihistamines, and by regularly rinsing your nasal passages with a salt water solution to keep your nose free of irritants. See your GP for advice if you've tried taking these steps and they haven't helped. They may prescribe a stronger medication, such as a nasal spray containing corticosteroids. Read more about treating allergic rhinitis and preventing allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include: nasal polyps \u2013 abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) sacs of fluid that grow inside the nasal passages and sinuses sinusitis \u2013 an infection caused by nasal inflammation and swelling that prevents mucus draining from the sinuses middle ear infections \u2013 infection of part of the ear located directly behind the eardrum These problems can often be treated with medication, although surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases. Read more about the complications of allergic rhinitis. ","Non-allergic rhinitis":"Not all cases of rhinitis are caused by an allergic reaction. Some cases are the result of: an infection, such as the common cold oversensitive blood vessels in the nose overuse of nasal decongestants This type of rhinitis is known as non-allergic rhinitis.

A blocked or runny nose can result in difficulty sleeping, drowsiness during the daytime, irritability and problems concentrating. Allergic rhinitis can also make symptoms of asthma worse. The inflammation associated with allergic rhinitis can also sometimes lead to other conditions, such as nasal polyps, sinusitis and middle ear infections. These are described below. Nasal polyps are swellings that grow in the lining inside your nose or sinuses, the small cavities above and behind your nose. They're caused by inflammation of the membranes of the nose and sometimes develop as a result of rhinitis. Nasal polyps are shaped like teardrops when they're growing and look like a grape on a stem when fully grown. They vary in size and can be yellow, grey or pink. They can grow on their own or in clusters, and usually affect both nostrils. If nasal polyps grow large enough, or in clusters, they can interfere with your breathing, reduce your sense of smell and block your sinuses, which can lead to sinusitis. Small nasal polyps can be shrunk using steroid nasal sprays so they don't cause an obstruction in your nose. Large polyps may need to be surgically removed. Read more about treating nasal polyps. Sinusitis is a common complication of rhinitis. It's where the sinuses become inflamed or infected. The sinuses naturally produce mucus, which usually drains into your nose through small channels. However, if the drainage channels are inflamed or blocked \u2013 for example, because of rhinitis or nasal polyps \u2013 the mucus can't drain away and it may become infected. Common symptoms of sinusitis include: a blocked nose, making it difficult to breathe through your nose a runny nose mucus that drips from the back of your nose down your throat (post-nasal drip) a reduced sense of smell or taste a feeling of fullness, pressure or pain in the face  snoring obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) \u2013 your airways become temporarily blocked while you're asleep, which can disturb your sleep Over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin, can be used to help reduce any pain and discomfort in your face. However, these medications aren't suitable for everyone, so check the leaflet that comes with them before using them. For example, children under the age of 16 shouldn't take aspirin, and ibuprofen isn't recommended for people with asthma or a history of stomach ulcers. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure. Antibiotics may also be recommended if your sinuses become infected with bacteria. If you have long-term (chronic) sinusitis, surgery may be needed to improve the drainage of your sinuses. Read more about treating sinusitis. Middle ear infections (otitis media) can also develop as a complication of nasal problems, including allergic rhinitis. These infections can occur if rhinitis causes a problem with the Eustachian tube, which connects the back of the nose and middle ear, at the back of the nose. If this tube doesn't function properly, fluid can build up in the middle ear behind the ear drum and can become infected. There's also the possibility of infection at the back of the nose spreading to the ear through the Eustachian tube. The main symptoms of a middle ear infection include: earache a high temperature (fever) being sick a lack of energy slight hearing loss Ear infections often clear up within a couple of days, but paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to help relieve fever and pain. Antibiotics may also be prescribed if the symptoms persist or are particularly severe. Read more about treating middle ear infections.

The allergic reaction isn't caused by animal fur, but flakes of dead animal skin and their urine and saliva. Dogs and cats are the most common culprits, although some people are affected by horses, cattle, rabbits and rodents, such as guinea pigs and hamsters. However, being around dogs from an early age can help protect against allergies, and there's some evidence to suggest that this might also be the case with cats. ","House dust mites":"House dust mites are tiny insects that feed on the dead flakes of human skin. They can be found in mattresses, carpets, soft furniture, pillows and beds. Rhinitis isn't caused by the dust mites themselves, but by a chemical found in their excrement. Dust mites are present all year round, although their numbers tend to peak during the winter. ","Work-related allergens":"Some people are affected by allergens found in their work environment, such as wood dust, flour dust or latex. It isn't fully understood why some people become oversensitive to allergens, although you're more likely to develop an allergy if there's a history of allergies in your family. If this is the case, you're said to be \"atopic\", or to have \"atopy\". People who are atopic have a genetic tendency to develop allergic conditions. Their increased immune response to allergens results in increased production of IgE antibodies.  Environmental factors may also play a part. Studies have shown certain things may increase the chance of a child developing allergies, such as growing up in a house where people smoke and being exposed to dust mites at a young age. Page last reviewed: 15/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 ","Pollen and spores":"Tiny particles of pollen produced by trees and grasses can sometimes cause allergic rhinitis. Most trees pollinate from early to mid-spring, whereas grasses pollinate at the end of spring and beginning of summer. Rhinitis can also be caused by spores produced by mould and fungi. ","Causes of allergic rhinitis ":"Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction to an allergen, such as pollen, dust and certain animals. If you have allergic rhinitis, your immune system \u2013 your natural defence against infection and illness \u2013 will react to an allergen as if it were harmful. If your immune system is oversensitive, it will react to allergens by producing antibodies to fight them off. Antibodies are special proteins in the blood that are usually produced to fight viruses and infections. Allergic reactions don't occur the first time you come into contact with an allergen. The immune system has to recognise and \"memorise\" it before producing antibodies to fight it. This process is known as sensitisation. After you develop sensitivity to an allergen, it will be detected by antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE) whenever it comes into contact with the inside of your nose and throat. These antibodies cause cells to release a number of chemicals, including histamine, which can cause the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become inflamed and produce excess mucus. This is what causes the typical symptoms of sneezing and a blocked or runny nose. Allergic rhinitis is triggered by breathing in tiny particles of allergens. The most common airborne allergens that cause rhinitis are described below. ","URL":"/conditions/rhinitis---allergic"},"Title":"Allergic rhinitis","Diagnosis":{"URL":"/conditions/rhinitis---allergic","Diagnosing allergic rhinitis ":"Your GP will often be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and your personal and family medical history. They'll ask you whether you've noticed any triggers that seem to cause a reaction, and whether it happens at a particular place or time. Your GP may examine the inside of your nose to check for nasal polyps. Nasal polyps are fleshy swellings that grow from the lining of your nose or your sinuses, the small cavities inside your nose. They can be caused by the inflammation that occurs as a result of allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is usually confirmed when medical treatment starts. If you respond well to antihistamines, it's almost certain that your symptoms are caused by an allergy. If the exact cause of allergic rhinitis is uncertain, your GP may refer you to a hospital allergy clinic for allergy testing. The two main allergy tests are: skin prick test \u2013 where the allergen is placed on your arm and the surface of the skin is pricked with a needle to introduce the allergen to your immune system; if you're allergic to the substance, a small itchy spot (welt) will appear blood test \u2013 to check for the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in your blood; your immune system produces this antibody in response to a suspected allergen Commercial allergy testing kits aren't recommended because the testing is often of a lower standard than that provided by the NHS or an accredited private clinic. It's also important that the test results are interpreted by a qualified healthcare professional with detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history. In some cases further hospital tests may be needed to check for complications, such as nasal polyps or sinusitis. For example, you may need: a nasal endoscopy \u2013 where a thin tube with a light source and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted up your nose so your doctor can see inside your nose a nasal inspiratory flow test \u2013 where a small device is placed over your mouth and nose to measure the air flow when you inhale through your nose a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a scan that uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body Page last reviewed: 15/02/2016 Next review due: 01/02/2019 "}},"Atherosclerosis":{"Introduction":{" ":"Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances called plaques, or atheroma. These plaques cause the arteries to harden and narrow, restricting the blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs, and increasing the risk of blood clots that could potentially block the flow of blood to the heart or brain. Atherosclerosis doesn't tend to have any symptoms at first, and many people may be unaware they have it, but it can eventually cause life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes if it gets worse. However, the condition is largely preventable with a healthy lifestyle, and treatment can help reduce the risk of serious problems occurring. This page covers: Health risks Who's at risk Tests and diagnosis Reduce your risk Treatments If left to get worse, atherosclerosis can potentially lead to a number of serious conditions known as cardiovascular disease (CVD). There won't usually be any symptoms until CVD develops. Types of CVD include: coronary heart disease \u2013 the main arteries that supply your heart (the coronary arteries) become clogged with plaques angina \u2013 short periods of tight, dull or heavy chest pain caused by coronary heart disease, which may precede a heart attack heart attacks \u2013 where the blood supply to your heart is blocked, causing sudden crushing or indigestion-like chest pain that can radiate to nearby areas, as well as shortness of breath and dizziness strokes \u2013 where the blood supply to your brain is interrupted, causing the face to droop to one side, weakness on one side of the body, and slurred speech transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) \u2013 where there are temporary symptoms of a stroke peripheral arterial disease \u2013 where the blood supply to your legs is blocked, causing leg pain when walking Click on the links above for more information about these conditions, including what the main symptoms and risks are. Exactly why and how arteries become clogged is unclear. It can happen to anyone, although the following things can increase your risk: increasing age smoking an unhealthy, high-fat diet lack of exercise being overweight or obese regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol other conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes a family history of atherosclerosis and CVD being of south Asian, African or African-Caribbean descent You can't do anything about some of these factors, but by tackling things such as an unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise, you can help reduce your risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Read more about the risk factors for CVD. Speak to your GP if you're worried you may be at a high risk of atherosclerosis. If you're between the ages of 40 and 74, you should have an NHS Health Check every five years, which will include tests to find out if you're at risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Your GP or practice nurse can work out your level of risk by taking into account factors such as: your age, gender and ethnic group your weight and height if you smoke or have previously smoked if you have a family history of CVD your blood pressure and cholesterol levels if you have certain long-term conditions Depending on your result, you may be advised to make lifestyle changes, consider taking medication, or have further tests to check for atherosclerosis and CVD. Making healthy lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of developing atherosclerosis and may help stop it getting worse. The main ways you can reduce your risk are: stop smoking \u2013 you can call the NHS Smokefree helpline for advice on 0300 123 1044 or ask your GP about stop smoking treatments; read more advice about stopping smoking  have a healthy diet \u2013 avoid foods that are high in saturated fats, salt or sugar, and aim to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day; read more healthy diet advice exercise regularly \u2013 aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, and strength exercises on at least two days a week maintain a healthy weight \u2013 aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 24.9; use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI and read advice about losing weight moderate your alcohol consumption \u2013 men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 alcohol units a week; get tips on cutting down on alcohol Click on the links above for more information.

You may also want to try the following: Put a sign on the toilet door, such as a photo of the toilet. Keep the toilet door open and make sure that the person you care for can access it easily. Make sure they can remove their clothes \u2013 some people with dementia can struggle with buttons and zips. Look out for signs that they may need to go to the toilet, such as fidgeting and standing up and down. Get adaptations to the toilet if necessary \u2013 you may be able to get these through a care and support needs assessment. If you're still having problems with incontinence, ask your GP to refer you to a continence advisor, who can advise on things like waterproof bedding or incontinence pads. People with dementia can become anxious about certain aspects of personal hygiene and may need help with washing. For example, they may be scared of falling when getting out of the bath, or they may become disorientated in the shower. The person you care for may not want to be left alone or they may resist washing, because they find the lack of privacy undignified and embarrassing. Try to do what's best for them. Read more about personal hygiene for people who are cared for. People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses such as arthritis that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems. Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, \"sleep hygiene\" measures are best for people with dementia \u2013 for example, no naps during the day, regular bedtimes, and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night. Read more about sleeping well. If you or a family member has dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone, and that help and support is available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group, or your GP can refer you to a counsellor in your area. It is important for a carer's physical health and psychological wellbeing that they are able to take a break (respite) from care. Carers may also need respite care if they have to go into hospital or meet other important commitments. Friends, relatives and neighbours can provide respite care at home. You can also arrange home respite care through home care agencies or, in some areas, your local authority. Care away from home can confuse some people with dementia, both while they are away and when they come back. If you decide on respite care away from the person's home, it is a good idea to visit beforehand to check that it meets the needs of the person with dementia. Caring for someone with dementia can be frustrating and stressful at times, but there are many organisations that can help. For more details, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends. Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia offers support for people diagnosed with dementia and their relatives and carers. GPs and other health professionals can recommend titles from a list of 25 books on dementia. The books are available for anyone to borrow for free from their local library.

People with dementia can feel vulnerable as their condition progresses and they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It is important that people who have dementia feel reassured and supported, while retaining some level of independence.  For more information, read staying independent with dementia. Although some symptoms are common to many people with dementia, each person's experience of the disease and how they cope with it will be different. When a person with dementia finds that their mental abilities are declining, they're likely to feel anxious, stressed and scared. They may be aware of their increasing clumsiness and inability to remember things, and this can be very frustrating and upsetting for them. If you are looking after someone with dementia, you can help them feel more secure by creating a regular daily routine in a relaxed environment, where they're encouraged and not criticised. Involving the person you look after in everyday tasks may make them feel useful and improve their sense of self-worth. They could help with the shopping, laying the table or sweeping leaves in the garden, for example. As the illness progresses, these tasks may become harder for them to manage independently, and you may need to give them more support. "},"Title":"Looking after someone with dementia"},"Anti-inflammatories, non-steroidal":{"Introduction":{" ":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications widely used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and bring down a high temperature (fever). They're often used to relieve symptoms of headaches, painful periods, sprains and strains, colds and flu, arthritis, and other causes of long-term pain. Although NSAIDs are commonly used, they're not suitable for everyone and can sometimes cause troublesome side effects. This information is a general overview of NSAIDs. For information about a specific medicine, you can look up your medication on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website. This page covers: Types of NSAIDs Who can take NSAIDs Side effects of NSAIDs Interactions with other medicines Food and alcohol Overdoses of NSAIDs Alternatives to NSAIDs NSAIDs are available as tablets, capsules, suppositories (capsules inserted into the bottom), creams, gels and injections. Some can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others need a prescription. The main types of NSAIDs include: ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac celecoxib mefenamic acid etoricoxib indometacin high-dose aspirin \u2013 low-dose aspirin isn't normally considered an NSAID NSAIDs may be sold under these names or a brand name. They're all similarly effective, although you may find a particular one works best for you. Most people can take NSAIDs, but some people need to be careful about taking them. It's a good idea to ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice before taking an NSAID if you: are over 65 years of age are pregnant or trying for a baby are breastfeeding have asthma have had an allergic reaction to NSAIDs in the past have had stomach ulcers in the past have any problems with your heart, liver, kidneys, blood pressure, circulation, or bowels are taking other medications \u2013 see interactions with other medicines are looking for medication for a child under 16 \u2013 any medication that contains aspirin should not be given to children under 16 NSAIDs might not necessarily need to be avoided in these cases, but they should only be used on the advice of a healthcare professional as there may be a higher risk of side effects. If NSAIDs aren't suitable, your pharmacist or doctor may suggest alternatives to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol. Like all medications, there's a risk of side effects from NSAIDs. These tend to be more common if you're taking high doses for a long time, or you're elderly or in poor general health. Over-the-counter NSAIDs generally have fewer side effects than stronger prescription medicines. Possible side effects of NSAIDs include: indigestion \u2013 including stomach aches, feeling sick and diarrhoea stomach ulcers \u2013 these can cause internal bleeding and anaemia; extra medication, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), may be prescribed to help reduce this risk a hole forming in the wall of your stomach or bowel headaches drowsiness dizziness allergic reactions in rare cases, problems with your liver, kidneys, or heart and circulation, such as heart failure, heart attacks and strokes If you experience any troublesome side effects, stop taking your medicine and tell your doctor. Some NSAIDs can react unpredictably with other medications. This can affect how well either medicine works and increase the risk of side effects. It's particularly important to get medical advice before taking an NSAID if you're already taking: another NSAID low-dose aspirin or warfarin \u2013 medicines used to prevent blood clots ciclosporin \u2013 a medicine used to treat autoimmune conditions such as arthritis or ulcerative colitis diuretics \u2013 medicines sometimes used to treat high blood pressure lithium \u2013 a medicine used to treat bipolar disorder and severe depression methotrexate \u2013 a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis a type of antidepressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) If you're not sure whether a medication you're taking can be taken at the same time as an NSAID, check the leaflet that comes with it, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice. The leaflet that comes with your medicine should say whether you need to avoid any particular foods or drinks. Ask your pharmacist or doctor if you're not sure. For information about a specific medicine, check the A-Z of medicine leaflets on the MHRA website. Generally, you don't need to avoid any specific foods while taking NSAIDs. Tablets or capsules should normally be swallowed with water or food to stop them upsetting your stomach. It's usually safe to drink alcohol while taking NSAIDs, but drinking alcohol excessively during treatment may irritate your stomach. Taking too much of an NSAID can be dangerous. This is known as taking an overdose. Contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice immediately if you take too much of your medicine and you experience problems such as feeling or being sick, an upset stomach, or drowsiness. Call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else experiences serious effects of an overdose, such as fits (seizures), breathing difficulties, or loss of consciousness. As NSAIDs can cause troublesome side effects, alternatives are often recommended first. The main alternative for pain relief is paracetamol, which is available over the counter and is safe for most people to take. NSAID creams and gels that you rub into your skin may be worth trying first if you have muscle or joint pain in a particular part of your body, as they tend to have fewer side effects than tablets or capsules. Your doctor may also be able to recommend different medicines and therapies depending on the condition you have. For example, physiotherapy may help some people with muscle or joint pain.

For more on side effects of epidurals in labour, read about pain relief in labour.  It's normal for blood pressure to fall a little when you have an epidural. Sometimes this can make you feel sick. Your blood pressure will be closely monitored. If necessary, fluids and medication can be passed through a drip to keep your blood pressure normal. After having an epidural, you may not be able to feel when your bladder is full because the epidural affects the surrounding nerves. A catheter may be inserted into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. Your bladder control will return to normal as soon as the epidural wears off. This can be a side effect of the pain relief drugs that may be used in your epidural. Medication can be given to help the itching, or the drug in the epidural can be changed. Feeling sick is less common with an epidural than with other pain relief methods like morphine and other opiates. It can be treated with anti-sickness medicines, or by raising your blood pressure if it's low. The epidural may not block all your pain. You may be offered an additional or alternative pain relief method. A severe headache can be caused if the bag of fluid that surrounds the spine is accidentally punctured. You may need specific treatment for the headache. A procedure known as a blood patch may be used to seal up the puncture. It involves taking a small sample of your blood and injecting it into the puncture. When the blood thickens (clots), the hole will be sealed and your headache will stop. Not all headaches require a blood patch. Your anaesthetist will discuss your options with you. Occasionally, some drugs used in the epidural can cause slow breathing or drowsiness. You will be monitored closely to spot this and it can be treated easily. The needle or epidural tube can damage nerves, but this is uncommon. This can cause loss of feeling or movement in parts of the lower body. The most common symptom is a small numb area with normal movement and strength. This usually gets better after a few days or weeks, but can sometimes take months. An infection can occasionally develop around the skin next to the epidural tube. It's rare for the infection to spread. Antibiotics may be necessary or, rarely, emergency surgery. In rare cases, an epidural can lead to permanent loss of feeling or movement in, for example, one or both legs. The causes are: direct damage from the epidural needle or catheter infection deep in the epidural area or near the spinal cord bleeding in the epidural area, causing pressure on the spinal cord accidentally injecting the wrong drugs down the epidural catheter These are rare events, and anaesthetists undergo extensive training to reduce the chances of these complications. Nerve damage can also happen for other reasons during surgery unrelated to the epidural. Other very rare complications of an epidural include: fits (convulsions) severe breathing difficulties death Before deciding to have an epidural, you should discuss the procedure with your anaesthetist. They can provide further information and advice on the risks of developing complications.

This page covers epidural anaesthesia, a type of epidural commonly given for pain relief in childbirth and in some types of surgery. When epidurals are used Preparing for an epidural How an epidural is given Recovering from an epidural Risks and side effects Epidurals can be used: during childbirth, including caesareans during some types of surgery  after some types of surgery Steroid medication can also be given as an epidural injection to treat back or leg pain caused by sciatica or a slipped (prolapsed) disc. If you have any concerns or questions about having an epidural, discuss these with your doctor. Let them know about any medication you're taking. You may be given specific advice about eating, drinking and medication before the epidural. As you won't be able to drive for 24 hours after having an epidural, you'll need to arrange for someone to give you a lift home. Epidurals are given by a specialist doctor called an anaesthetist. You're usually awake during an epidural, but for some types of surgery you may have it while under general anaesthetic. A drip will be placed in your arm so you can be given fluids while you're having the epidural. You'll be asked to sit down and lean forwards, or lie on your side with your knees drawn up. You'll be given an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the skin where the epidural is to be inserted. A needle is used to insert a fine plastic tube called an epidural catheter between the bones of your back. The needle is then removed, leaving just the catheter in your back. You may feel mild discomfort when the epidural needle is positioned and the catheter is inserted. The epidural can be inserted at different levels of your back depending on the area of the body that requires pain relief. Pain relief drugs are then given through the catheter. These take about 20-30 minutes to take full effect. Your chest, tummy and legs may feel numb while the epidural is being used, and your legs may not feel as strong as normal. While the catheter remains in your back, it can be used to top up your pain relief drugs manually or using an automatic pump. This can be for several hours (during childbirth) or for a few days (after major surgery). Mobile epidurals, which use a lower dose of pain relief drugs, are sometimes used in childbirth, allowing you to walk around during labour. When the epidural is stopped, the numbness usually lasts for a few hours before its effects begin to wear off. While the drugs wear off, you'll probably be advised to rest in a lying or sitting position until the feeling in your legs returns. This can take a couple of hours, and you may feel a slight tingling sensation in your skin. Tell the doctor or nurse if you feel any pain. They can give you medicines to help control it. Do not drive, operate machinery or drink alcohol for 24 hours after having an epidural. Epidurals are usually safe, but there's a small risk of side effects and complications, including: low blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded or nauseous temporary loss of bladder control itchy skin feeling sick headaches nerve damage Read more about the side effects and complications of an epidural.

This is because the risk of the AAA bursting is smaller than the risk of complications of surgery. You'll be asked to come back for regular ultrasound scans to check if your aneurysm is getting bigger. Scans are done: every year if you have a small AAA every three months if you have a medium AAA Surgery may be offered if your aneurysm becomes a large AAA. You'll also be told about lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of an aneurysm getting bigger, such as eating healthily. Read more about how to stop an aneurysm growing. You can otherwise carry on as normal, although having an AAA may have some implications for things such as driving and getting travel insurance. Read some frequently asked questions about AAAs for more information. If you have a large AAA, surgery to strengthen it with a piece of man-made tubing (a graft) is usually recommended because the risk of it bursting is bigger than the risk of surgery complications. There are two main types of surgery for an AAA: endovascular surgery \u2013 the graft is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin and then carefully passed up into the aorta open surgery \u2013 the graft is placed in the aorta through a cut in your tummy Both techniques are equally good at reducing the risk of an AAA bursting, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Talk to your surgeon about which is best for you. If surgery isn't suitable for you, you'll have regular scans to monitor your aneurysm and be given advice about healthy lifestyle changes, and you may be prescribed medication to help stop the aneurysm bursting. ","Open surgery":"During open surgery, a cut is made in your tummy and your surgeon replaces the affected section of aorta with a graft. This is done under general anaesthetic. You'll usually stay in hospital for 7-10 days after the operation, and it'll take a few weeks or months to fully recover. The risk of complications is generally higher than with endovascular surgery, and the hospital stay and recovery time is often longer. Around 95-97% of people make a full recovery. Risks of open surgery include: a wound infection or infection of the graft a blood clot heavy bleeding from your groin a heart attack or stroke in men, erectile dysfunction or ejaculation problems The risk of graft problems is lower than with endovascular surgery. The graft will usually work well for the rest of your life and you won't normally need regular scans to check it. Watch a video about open surgery for an AAA. A burst aneurysm is treated with emergency surgery using the same techniques used for a large aneurysm. The decision about whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made by the surgeon carrying out the operation. Only about 2 in 10 people who have a burst aneurysm survive, which is why an operation to stop an aneurysm bursting is usually recommended if it's large. ","Endovascular surgery":"In endovascular surgery, a graft is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin through small cuts made in your skin. It's then carefully guided up into the aneurysm. This is usually done under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. You'll normally stay in hospital for two or three days after the operation, and it'll take a few weeks or months to fully recover. The risk of complications is generally lower than with open surgery, and the hospital stay and recovery time is often shorter. Around 98% of people make a full recovery. Risks of endovascular surgery include: the graft leaking or slipping out of position \u2013 you'll have regular scans to check for this, and you may need another operation to fix any problems a wound infection or infection of the graft heavy bleeding from your groin a blood clot, heart attack or stroke Watch a video about endovascular surgery for an AAA.

An AAA can be dangerous if it isn't spotted early on. It can get bigger over time and could burst (rupture), causing life-threatening bleeding. Men aged 65 and over are most at risk of AAAs. This is why men are invited for screening to check for an AAA when they're 65. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical help Who's at risk Treatments Reducing your risk Screening AAAs don't usually cause any obvious symptoms, and are often only picked up during screening or tests carried out for another reason. Some people with an AAA have: a pulsing sensation in the tummy (like a heartbeat) tummy pain that doesn't go away lower back pain that doesn't go away If an AAA bursts, it can cause: sudden, severe pain in the tummy or lower back dizziness sweaty, pale and clammy skin a fast heartbeat shortness of breath fainting or passing out Make an appointment to see your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of an AAA, especially if you're at a higher risk of an AAA. An ultrasound scan of your tummy may be done to check if you have an AAA. Call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else develops symptoms of a burst AAA. An AAA can form if the sides of the aorta weaken and balloon outwards. It's not always clear why this happens, but there are things that increase the risk. People at a higher risk of getting an AAA include: men aged 65 or over \u2013 AAAs are up to six times more common in men than women, and the risk of getting one goes up as you get older people who smoke \u2013 if you smoke or used to smoke, you're up to 15 times more likely to get an AAA people with high blood pressure \u2013 high blood pressure can double your risk of getting an AAA people with a parent, sibling or child with an AAA \u2013 you're about four times more likely to get an AAA if a close relative has had one Speak to your GP if you're worried you may be at risk of an AAA. They may suggest having a scan to check if you have one and making healthy lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of an AAA. The recommended treatment for an AAA depends on how big it is. Treatment isn't always needed straight away if the risk of an AAA bursting is low. Treatment for a: small AAA (3cm to 4.4cm across) \u2013 ultrasound scans are recommended every year to check if it's getting bigger; you'll be advised about healthy lifestyle changes to help stop it growing medium AAA (4.5cm to 5.4cm) \u2013 ultrasound scans are recommended every three months to check if it's getting bigger; you'll also be advised about healthy lifestyle changes large AAA (5.5cm or more) \u2013 surgery to stop it getting bigger or bursting is usually recommended Ask your doctor if you're not sure what size your AAA is. Read more about treatments for AAAs. There are several things you can do to reduce your chances of getting an AAA or help stop one getting bigger. These include: stopping smoking \u2013 read stop smoking advice and find out about Smokefree, the NHS stop smoking service eating healthily \u2013 eat a balanced diet and cut down on fatty food exercising regularly \u2013 aim to do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week; read about how to get started with some common activities maintaining a healthy weight \u2013 use the healthy weight calculator to see if you might need to lose weight, and find out how to lose weight safely cutting down on alcohol \u2013 read some tips on cutting down and general advice about alcohol If you have a condition that increases your risk of an AAA, such as high blood pressure, your GP may also recommend taking tablets to treat this. In England, screening for AAA is offered to men during the year they turn 65. This can help spot a swelling in the aorta early on, when it can be treated. The test involves a quick and painless ultrasound scan to see how big your aorta is. If you're a man over 65 and you haven't been screened, you can request a test by contacting your local AAA screening service directly. Women and men under 65 aren't routinely invited for screening. But if you think you might have a higher risk of an AAA, talk to your GP about the possibility of having a scan. Read more about screening for an AAA.

Infection can occur if there are bacteria on your skin or on the instruments being used. However, severe infection occurs in less than 1 in every 1,000 procedures. ","Inadequate sample":"In around 1% of procedures, the sample of cells removed may not be suitable for testing. This could be because not enough cells were taken, or because the sample was contaminated with cells from the mother. If the sample is unsuitable, it may be necessary for the CVS procedure to be carried out again, or to wait a few weeks to have amniocentesis instead. ","Miscarriage":"CVS carries a risk of miscarriage, which is the loss of a pregnancy within the first 23 weeks. The risk of miscarriage after CVS is estimated to be about 1-2%. This means that 1 in every 50 to 100 women will have a miscarriage after having CVS. However, it's difficult to determine which miscarriages would have happened anyway, and which are the result of the CVS procedure. Some recent research has suggested that only a very small number of miscarriages that occur after CVS are a direct result of the procedure. In most cases, miscarriages linked to CVS occur within two weeks of the procedure. There's no evidence to suggest you can do anything during this time to reduce your risk. The risk of miscarriage after CVS is considered to be slightly higher than after an alternative test called amniocentesis, which is carried out slightly later in pregnancy. ","Rhesus sensitisation":"If your blood type is rhesus (RhD) negative, but your baby\u2019s blood type is RhD positive, it's possible for sensitisation to occur during CVS.  This is where some of your baby's blood enters your bloodstream and your body starts to produce antibodies to attack it. If it's not treated, this can cause the baby to develop rhesus disease. If you don't already know your blood type, a blood test will be carried out before CVS to see if there's a risk of sensitisation. An injection of a medication called anti-D immunoglobulin can be given to stop sensitisation occurring, if necessary. Read more about preventing rhesus disease.

You may also find it helpful to contact a support group, such as Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC). ARC is a charity that offers information, advice and support on all issues related to screening during pregnancy. The test will usually tell you whether your baby will be born with any of the genetic conditions that were tested for. If no problem is found, it may be reassuring. A result showing that a genetic condition was detected will give you plenty of time to decide how you want to proceed with your pregnancy. Read about the results of CVS for more information.

","Getting your results":"The first results of the test should be available within three working days and this will tell you whether a major chromosome condition, such as Down's, Edward's or Patau's syndrome, has been discovered. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back. If your test shows that your baby has a genetic or chromosomal condition, the implications will be fully discussed with you. There's no cure for most of the conditions CVS finds, so you'll need to consider your options carefully. You may choose to continue with your pregnancy, while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared, or you may consider having a termination (abortion). Read more about the results of CVS. ","Introduction ":"Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a test you may be offered during pregnancy to check if your baby has a genetic or chromosomal condition, such as Down\u2019s, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. It involves removing and testing a small sample of cells from the placenta (the organ linking the mother\u2019s blood supply with her unborn baby\u2019s). ","What are the risks of CVS?":"Before you decide to have CVS, the risks and possible complications will be discussed with you. One of the main risks associated with CVS is miscarriage, which is the loss of the pregnancy in the first 23 weeks. This is estimated to occur in 0.5% to 1% of women who have CVS. There are also some other risks, such as infection or needing to have the procedure again because it wasn't possible to accurately test the first sample that was removed. The risk of CVS causing complications is higher if it's carried out before the 10th week of pregnancy, which is why the test is only carried out after this point. Read more about the risks of CVS. ","How CVS is performed":"CVS is usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, although it's sometimes performed later than this if necessary. During the test, a small sample of cells will be removed from the placenta using one of two methods: transabdominal CVS \u2013 a needle is inserted through your tummy (this is the most common method used) transcervical CVS \u2013 a tube or small forceps (smooth metal instruments that look like tongs) are inserted through the cervix (the neck of the womb) The test itself takes about 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes. The CVS procedure is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful, although you may experience some cramps that are similar to period pains for a day or two afterwards. Read more about what happens during CVS. ","URL":"/conditions/Chorionic-Villus-sampling","What are the alternatives?":"An alternative to CVS is a test called amniocentesis. This is where a small sample of amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb) is removed for testing. It's usually carried out between the 15th and 18th week of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary. This test has a similar risk of causing a miscarriage, but your pregnancy will be at a more advanced stage before you can get the results, so you'll have a bit less time to consider your options. If you're offered tests to look for a genetic or chromosomal condition in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you, and help you make a decision. Page last reviewed: 06/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 "},"What happens":{"Is CVS painful?":"CVS is usually described as being uncomfortable, rather than painful. In most cases, an injection of local anaesthetic will be given before transabdominal CVS to numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may have a sore tummy afterwards. Transcervical CVS feels similar to a cervical screening test. ","Recovering after CVS":"After CVS, it's normal to have cramps similar to period pain and light vaginal bleeding called \"spotting\" for a day or two. You can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol (but not ibuprofen or aspirin) if you experience any discomfort. You may wish to avoid any strenuous activity for the rest of the day. Contact your midwife or the hospital where the procedure was carried out for advice as soon as possible if you develop any of the following symptoms after the procedure: persistent or severe pain a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or more chills or shivering heavy vaginal bleeding discharge of clear fluid from the vagina contractions ","Getting the results":"The first results should be available within a few days, and this will tell you whether a major chromosome problem has been discovered. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back. You can usually choose whether to get the results over the phone or during a face-to-face meeting at the hospital or at home. Read more about the results of CVS. Page last reviewed: 06/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 ","What happens during chorionic villus sampling ":"Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) involves taking a sample of cells from the tissue of the placenta (the 'chorionic villi'). ","Preparing for CVS":"You won't usually need to do anything special to prepare for CVS. You can eat and drink as normal beforehand. In some cases, you may be advised to avoid going to the toilet for a few hours before the test, because it's sometimes easier to perform when your bladder is full. Your doctor or midwife will tell you about this before you attend your appointment. You may want to bring a partner, friend or family member for support when you have the test. ","Which method will be used?":"The transabdominal method is preferred in most cases, because it's often easier to carry out. Transcervical CVS is also more likely to cause vaginal bleeding immediately after the procedure, which occurs in about 1 in every 10 women who have this procedure. There is, however, no difference in the rate of miscarriages between the two methods. Transcervical CVS may be preferred to transabdominal CVS if it's easier to reach your placenta this way. ","How CVS is performed":"CVS is carried out under the continuous guidance of an ultrasound scan. This is to make sure nothing enters the amniotic sac (protective sac that cushions the baby) or touches the baby. The test can be carried out using two different methods: transabdominal CVS and transcervical CVS. Your tummy is first cleaned with antiseptic before a local anaesthetic injection is used to numb it. A needle is then inserted through your skin into the womb. The needle is guided to the placenta using the image on the ultrasound scan. Attached to the needle is a syringe, which is used to extract a small sample of cells from the chorionic villi. After the sample is removed, the needle is removed.  A sample of cells from the chorionic villi is collected through your cervix (the neck of the womb). A thin tube attached to a syringe or small forceps are inserted through your vagina and cervix, and guided towards the placenta using the ultrasound scan. ","How long does it take?":"The procedure usually takes around 10 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you will be monitored for up to an hour, in case the test causes any side effects, such as heavy bleeding. You can then go home to rest. It's a good idea to arrange for someone to drive you home, as you might not feel up to it yourself. ","URL":"/conditions/Chorionic-Villus-sampling"},"Results":{"Getting the results":"The first results should be available within three working days, and this will tell you whether a major chromosome problem such as Down's syndrome has been found. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back. You can usually choose whether to get the results over the phone or during a face-to-face meeting at the hospital or at home. You'll also receive written confirmation of the results. ","What the results mean":"For many women who have CVS, the results of the procedure will be \"normal\". This means that none of the genetic disorders that were tested for were found in the baby. However, a normal result doesn't guarantee that your baby will be completely healthy, as the test only checks for conditions caused by faulty genes, and it cannot exclude every possible genetic disorder. If your test is \"positive\", your baby has one of the disorders it was tested for. In this instance, the implications will be fully discussed with you and you'll need to decide how to proceed. ","Results of chorionic villus sampling  ":"After chorionic villus sampling (CVS) has been carried out, the sample of cells will be sent to a laboratory to be tested. The number of chromosomes (bundles of genes) in the cells can be counted, and the structure of the chromosomes can be checked for any abnormalities. If CVS is being carried out to test for a specific genetic disorder, the cells in the sample can also be tested for this. ","What happens if a problem is found":"If the test finds that your baby will be born with a genetic disorder, you'll speak to a number of specialists about what this means. This may be your midwife, a doctor with experience in childhood genetic conditions, a geneticist and/or a genetic counsellor. They'll be able to give you detailed information about the condition \u2013 including the problems your child may have, the treatment and support they might need, and whether their life expectancy will be affected \u2013 to help you decide what to do. There's no cure for most genetic conditions, so you'll need to consider your options carefully. Your main options are: continue with your pregnancy while gathering information about the condition, so you're prepared for caring for your baby have a termination (abortion) \u2013 read more about termination for foetal abnormalities This can be a very difficult decision, but you don't have to make it on your own. As well as discussing it with specialist healthcare professionals, talk things over with your partner and speak to close friends and family, if you think it might help. The charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) can also offer support and impartial information. Page last reviewed: 06/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018 ","URL":"/conditions/Chorionic-Villus-sampling","How reliable are the results?":"CVS is estimated to give a definitive result in around 99% of cases. However, it cannot test for every birth defect and it's not always possible to get a conclusive result. In a very small number of cases, the results of CVS cannot establish with certainty that the chromosomes in the baby are normal or not. This might be because the sample of cells removed was too small or there's a possibility the abnormality is just in the placenta and not the baby. If this happens, it may be necessary to have amniocentesis (an alternative test, in which a sample of amniotic fluid is taken from the mother) a few weeks later to confirm a diagnosis. "},"Title":"Chorionic villus sampling"},"Autism spectrum disorder":{"Treatment":{"Treating autism spectrum disorder ":"There's no 'cure' for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there are a range of specialist interventions that aim to improve communication skills and help with educational and social development. It can be difficult to know which intervention will work best for your child, because each person with ASD is affected differently. Some types of intervention can involve hours of intensive work, and this isn't always possible for many families because of the practical, emotional and financial commitments necessary. The National Autistic Society website has information about the many different strategies and approaches available for ASD. Any intervention should focus on important aspects of your child's development. These are: communication skills \u2013 such as using pictures to help communicate (as speech and language skills are usually significantly delayed) social interaction skills \u2013 such as the ability to understand other people's feelings and respond to them imaginative play skills \u2013 such as encouraging pretend play academic skills \u2013 the \"traditional\" skills a child needs to progress with their education, such as reading, writing and maths The detailed assessment, management and co-ordination of care for children and young people with ASD should involve local specialist community-based multidisciplinary teams (sometimes called \"local autism teams\") working together. The team may include: a paediatrician mental heath specialists, such as a psychologist and psychiatrist a learning disability specialist a speech and language therapist an occupational therapist education and social care services Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with ASD has a case manager or key worker to manage and co-ordinate their treatment, care and support, as well as their transition into adult care. The Research Autism website provides details of the many different types of autism interventions, treatments and therapies. ","Medication":"In some cases, medication may be prescribed to treat some of the symptoms or conditions associated with ASD. For example: sleeping problems \u2013 this may be treated with a medication such as melatonin depression \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) epilepsy \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication called an anticonvulsant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \u2013 this may be treated with a medication such as methylphenidate aggressive and challenging behaviour, such as tantrums or self-harming \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication called an antipsychotic if the behaviour is severe or psychological treatments haven't helped These medications can have significant side effects and are usually only prescribed by a doctor who specialises in the condition being treated. If medication is offered, your child will have regular check-ups to assess whether it's working. ","Psychosocial treatments":"If your child's behaviour is causing problems, they'll be assessed for possible triggers, such as a physical health condition, mental health problem, or environmental factors. A physical or mental cause will be addressed using medication and/or psychological treatments. In some cases, such as where a child with ASD also has an anxiety problem, a psychosocial treatment may also be recommended. These are supportive treatments that help people overcome challenges and maintain good mental health. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides more information about interventions for challenging behaviour. ","Treatments not recommended":"A number of alternative treatments have been suggested for ASD. However, these should be avoided, because there's little or no evidence that they're effective and some may even be potentially dangerous. Treatments that aren't recommended for ASD include: special diets \u2013 such as gluten-free or casein-free diets neurofeedback \u2013 where brain activity is monitored (usually by placing electrodes on the head) and the person being treated can see their brain activity on a screen and is taught how to change it auditory integration training \u2013 a therapy that involves listening to music that varies in tone, pitch and volume chelation therapy \u2013 which uses medication or other agents to remove metal (in particular, mercury) from the body hyperbaric oxygen therapy \u2013 treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber facilitated communication \u2013 where a therapist or another person supports and guides a person's hand or arm while using a device such as a computer keyboard or mouse ","Funding treatments":"Some of the interventions for ASD take a lot of time and labour, and can cost a significant amount of money if not available on the NHS. Many local education authorities (LEAs) provide partial or sometimes total funding towards specialist education and training, but this varies widely between LEAs. Read more about Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND). If you would like more information and advice about what funding is available and how to request it, The National Autistic Society runs a special service called the Education Rights Service.

If your child has ASD, it's a good idea to find out as much as you can about the condition. The National Autistic Society website provides useful information and advice for parents, relatives and carers. The Research Autism website is also a good source of information and has a section about the different issues that living with autism presents, including the impact of autism on the family. Communication is particularly challenging for children with ASD. Helping your child to communicate can reduce anxiety and improve behaviour. The following tips may be useful when communicating and interacting with your child: use your child's name, so they know you're addressing them keep background noise to a minimum keep language simple speak slowly and clearly, with pauses between words accompany what you say with simple gestures allow extra time for your child to process what you've said  In-depth advice and support programmes are available for parents of children recently diagnosed with ASD. For example, the EarlyBird programme provided by The National Autistic Society is a free three-month course for parents whose child has been diagnosed with ASD, but hasn't started school yet. The programme aims to inform and support parents, and offers practical advice about looking after their child and helping them improve their skills. EarlyBird Plus is for parents of children who have received a later diagnosis of ASD and are four to eight years of age. The programme aims to address the child's needs at both home and school by training parents and carers, together with a professional who regularly works with their child. EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus programmes are run by licensed teams and are available in most parts of the UK.

In early infancy, some children with ASD don\u2019t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others \u2013 for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They\u2019ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. They can find it hard to understand other people's emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won\u2019t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don\u2019t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they\u2019re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking), learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression. About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these, 50% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of people with \"severe learning difficulties\" have an ASD. Read more about the symptoms of ASD. ","Introduction ":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a range of similar conditions, including Asperger syndrome, that affect a person's social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. It's estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. There's no \"cure\" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. Read about help and support available for people with ASD. ","Autism in adults":"Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. For example, a number of autism-specific services are available that provide adults with ASD with the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities. Read more about adults with ASD. Page last reviewed: 06/01/2016 Next review due: 01/09/2018 ","Caring for someone with ASD":"Being a carer isn't an easy role. When you're busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. If you're caring for someone else, it's important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you care for.

","URL":"/conditions/Autistic-spectrum-disorder","What causes ASD?":"The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it's thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. In the past, some people believed the MMR vaccine caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. Read more about the causes of ASD. "},"Causes":{"Environmental triggers":"Some researchers believe that a person born with a genetic vulnerability to ASD only develops the condition if they're exposed to a specific environmental trigger. Possible triggers include being born prematurely (before 35 weeks of pregnancy), or being exposed in the womb to alcohol or to certain medication, such as sodium valproate (sometimes used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy). No conclusive evidence has been found linking pollution or maternal infections in pregnancy with an increased risk of ASD. ","Genes":"Most researchers believe that certain genes a child inherits from their parents could make them more vulnerable to developing ASD. Cases of ASD have been known to run in families. For example, younger siblings of children with ASD can also develop the condition, and it's common for identical twins to both develop ASD. No specific genes linked to ASD have been identified, but it may be a presenting feature of some rare genetic syndromes, including Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and Angelman syndrome. ","Causes of autism spectrum disorder ":"The exact cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently unknown. It's a complex condition and may occur as a result of genetic predisposition (a natural tendency), environmental or unknown factors. ","Other health conditions":"Below are some other conditions known to be associated with ASD: muscular dystrophy \u2013 a group of inherited genetic conditions that gradually cause the muscles to weaken Down's syndrome \u2013 a genetic condition that typically causes a learning disability and a range of physical features cerebral palsy \u2013 conditions that affect the brain and nervous system, causing problems with movement and co-ordination infantile spasms \u2013 a type of epilepsy that develops while a child is still very young (usually before they're one year old) neurofibromatosis \u2013 a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2) the rare genetic conditions fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome  ","URL":"/conditions/Autistic-spectrum-disorder","Misconceptions about the causes of ASD":"In the past, a number of things were linked to ASD, but extensive research has found no evidence to suggest that any of these contribute to the condition. These include: the MMR vaccine thiomersal \u2013 a compound that contains mercury, which is used as a preservative in some vaccines the way a person has been brought up diet, such as eating gluten or dairy products Page last reviewed: 06/01/2016 Next review due: 01/09/2018 "},"Title":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)","Adults with autism":{"Caring for an adult with ASD":"Many adults with ASD continue to live in their family home, and some are cared for by family members. Caring for anyone with a disability can be challenging, and parents may need additional support. If you're caring for an adult with ASD, you may consider respite care. This is short-term care provided either in or outside the family home. It is funded by your local authority and gives families and carers of people with ASD a break from their daily care routine. For more information, see your guide to care and support and carers' breaks and respite care. Page last reviewed: 06/01/2016 Next review due: 01/09/2018 ","Adults living with autism ":"Some people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) grow up without their condition being recognised, sometimes through choice. However, a diagnosis can make it easier to access a range of support services that may be available locally. It's never too late to be diagnosed with ASD, although it's not always easy because some local NHS authorities don't provide NHS funding for diagnosing ASD in adults. Read more about diagnosing ASD in adults, or see The National Autistic Society website for further information about autism diagnosis for adults. ","Employment":"It can be difficult for people with ASD to find a job. For example, they may find the work environment too noisy, or travelling to work may be too stressful because of the crowds. Sudden changes in routine can also be upsetting. However, in the right job and with the right support, people with ASD have much to offer. They're often accurate, reliable, and have a good eye for detail. Being in a working environment can help the individual's personal development tremendously.  Read about disability in the workplace and the Equality Act. If you're having problems getting a job or staying in a job, you may be able to access a supported employment programme in your local area. These programmes can help you write your CV and job applications, and prepare you for interviews. They can also help you choose which jobs would suit you and provide training for that role. Those providing the programme can also advise employers about any changes that need to be made to the workplace to suit people with ASD, as well as supporting you and the employer before and after you've started work. See The National Autistic Society website to find help with getting a job. ","Making decisions":"Someone with ASD may have the capacity to make some decisions (for example, to decide what items to buy at the local shop), but lack capacity to make other decisions (for example, making decisions about complex financial issues). Where someone is judged not to have the capacity to make a specific decision after they've had a capacity assessment, that decision can be taken for them \u2013 but it must be in their best interests. For more information, read What is the Mental Capacity Act? ","Benefits":"Adults diagnosed with ASD can also claim some benefits, such as the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). This is the new benefit replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for people with a disability who are aged 16 to 64. You can find out more about benefits for adults with autism on The National Autistic Society website, or you can visit GOV.UK to read more about benefits. ","Accommodation":"Adults with ASD can live in all types of housing. Some people may be suited to a residential care home, while others may prefer to live on their own and receive home support. Some people with ASD live completely independently. Supported living can work very well for some adults with ASD, because it means they can choose a place to live in the community, either alone or with other people, with the support they need. They may need 24-hour care, or they may only need help with important tasks for a couple of hours each week. The level of support an adult with ASD needs will be decided after your local authority's social services carry out an assessment, and it's agreed with the person and their carer. Read more about care assessments. ","URL":"/conditions/Autistic-spectrum-disorder","Treatment and support":"With a proper diagnosis, adults with ASD may be able to access local autism support services, if available in their area. You can search for services for adults using the Autism Services Directory. The healthcare professionals who diagnose you with ASD should be able to provide more information and advice about the care and support services available to you. Read about assessing your care and support needs. Examples of programmes that may be available in your local area include: social learning programmes \u2013 to help you cope in social situations leisure activity programmes \u2013 these involve taking part in leisure activities, such as games, exercise, or going to the cinema or theatre with a group of people skills for daily living programmes \u2013 to help you if you have problems carrying out daily activities, such as eating and washing Adults with ASD may also benefit from some of the treatments offered to children with ASD, such as psychological therapy and medication.

"},"Diagnosis":{"Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder ":"See your GP or health visitor if your child is showing symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or you're worried about their development. If appropriate, your GP can refer you to a healthcare professional or team who specialise in diagnosing ASD, or someone who has access to such a team. The specialist or specialist team will make a more in-depth assessment, which should be started within three months of the referral. If you're referred to an individual specialist, they may be a: psychologist \u2013 a healthcare professional with a psychology degree, plus further training and qualifications in psychology psychiatrist \u2013 a medically qualified doctor with further training in psychiatry paediatrician \u2013 a doctor who specialises in treating children speech and language therapist \u2013 a specialist in recognising and treating communication problems Some local health authorities use multidisciplinary teams. These are a combination of specialists who work together to make an assessment. A diagnosis of ASD is based on the range of features your child is showing. For most children: information will be needed from your GP, nursery or school staff, plus speech and language and occupational therapists, about your child's development, health and behaviour a speech and language therapist, and often an occupational therapist, will carry out an assessment a detailed physical examination will need to be carried out to rule out possible physical causes of your child's symptoms, such as an underlying condition like neurofibromatosis or Down's syndrome  the assessment will include a check for any coexisting physical health conditions and mental health problems In addition, for some children: you may be asked to attend a series of interviews so a detailed family history and the history of your child's development and behaviour can be drawn up your child may be asked to attend a series of appointments so specific skills and activities can be observed and assessed  Once this process is complete, a diagnosis of ASD may be confirmed. When a child is diagnosed with ASD, many parents are keen to find out as much as they can about the condition. The National Autistic Society has an excellent range of resources and advice. ","Diagnosing ASD in adults":"Some people with ASD grow up without their condition being recognised, but it's never too late to get a diagnosis. Some people may be scared of being diagnosed because they feel it will \"label\" them, and lower other people's expectations of them.  But there are several advantages to getting a diagnosis. It helps people with the condition and their families understand ASD and decide what sort of support they need. A diagnosis may also make it easier to access autism-specific services and claim benefits. See your GP if you think you may have ASD and ask them to refer you to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. The National Autistic Society website has information about being diagnosed with ASD if you're an adult. If you're already seeing a specialist for other reasons, you may want to ask them for a referral instead. Read more about diagnosing ASD in adults and advice for adults living with ASD.

Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body and the heart muscle. This page covers: Symptoms and health risks Causes How to reduce your risk Treatments A blood clot doesn't usually have any symptoms until it blocks the flow of blood to part of the body. This can cause several serious problems, including: a heart attack \u2013 when blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, causing chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness a stroke \u2013 when blood flow to the brain is cut off; the main symptoms are the face dropping on one side, weakness in one arm and slurred speech a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or \"mini-stroke\" \u2013 when blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked, causing short-lived stroke symptoms critical limb ischaemia \u2013 when the blood supply to a limb is blocked, causing it to become painful, discoloured (either pale or blue) and cold These conditions are all medical emergencies. Get medical help straight away if you or someone in your care is experiencing these symptoms. Arterial thrombosis usually affects people whose arteries are clogged with fatty deposits. This is known as atherosclerosis. These deposits cause the arteries to harden and narrow over time and increase the risk of blood clots. The following can increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis: getting older smoking an unhealthy diet lack of exercise being overweight or obese regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol other conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes a family history of atherosclerosis being of south Asian, African or African-Caribbean descent Sometimes arterial thrombosis can be due to a condition that makes your blood more likely to clot, such as atrial fibrillation or antiphospholipid syndrome. It's not possible to prevent blood clots entirely, but you can reduce your risk by lowering your risk of atherosclerosis. The main things you can do are: stop smoking  have a healthy diet exercise regularly maintain a healthy weight \u2013 read advice about losing weight cut down on your alcohol consumption If you're at a high risk of getting a blood clot, your doctor may also recommend taking medication such as: statins for high cholesterol medicines for high blood pressure medicines to reduce the risk of your blood clotting \u2013 for example, anticoagulants (such as warfarin) and antiplatelets (such as low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel) If you develop arterial thrombosis, it may need to be treated with medication or surgery. Treatments include: injections of a medicine called a thrombolytic that can dissolve some blood clots an operation to remove the clot (embolectomy) an operation to widen the affected artery \u2013 for example, an angioplasty (where a hollow tube is placed in the artery to hold it open) surgery to divert blood around the blocked artery \u2013 for example, a coronary artery bypass graft (where a blood vessel taken from another part of the body is used to bypass a blockage in the artery that supplies the heart muscle) As well as arterial thrombosis, there are several other types of blood clot, including: venous thromboembolism (VTE) \u2013 a blood clot in a vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body, usually in the leg embolism \u2013 where the blood flow in an artery is blocked by a foreign body; this can be a blood clot or something else such as an air bubble pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the pulmonary artery, which transports blood from the heart to the lungs Page last reviewed: 08/02/2017 Next review due: 08/02/2020 ","URL":"/conditions/arterial-thrombosis"},"Title":"Arterial thrombosis"},"Coping with an overactive child":{"Introduction":{"URL":"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/is-my-child-overactive.aspx","Ways to get your baby moving":"Ways to get your baby moving Why tummy time is important Baby bouncers, walkers and seats Physical activity for toddlers Enjoy being active together Activity for young children with a disability Coping with a very active toddler Does my child have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? Lay your baby down on their back so they can kick their legs. Pulling, pushing, grasping and playing with other people are great ways to practise different kinds of movements. Once your baby has started crawling, let them crawl around the floor, but make sure it's safe first \u2013 see our crawling safety checklist. Playing outdoors helps your baby learn about their surroundings. You can take your baby swimming from a very young age \u2013 there's no need to wait until they've been vaccinated. See Start4Life for more activity tips for babies. Tummy time helps to build the muscles your baby needs for sitting and crawling. Your baby can start to spend time on their tummy from about three months. Little and often is best to begin with. If your baby has difficulty lifting their head you can roll up a towel and put it under their armpits. Put some toys nearby for them to reach out to. Only do tummy time when your baby is awake and alert, and you're there to keep an eye on them. It's important that your baby doesn't spend too much time in: baby walkers or bouncers \u2013 these encourage babies to stand on their tiptoes and can delay walking if your baby uses them a lot baby carriers and seats \u2013 long periods in reclining carriers or seats, or seats that prop your baby in a sitting position, can delay your baby's ability to sit up on their own If you do use a baby walker, bouncer or seat, it's best to use them for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Once your child is walking, they should be physically active for at least 180 minutes (three hours) a day, spread throughout the day. Let your toddler walk with you rather than always using the buggy. Toddlers and young children love going to the park, where they can climb and swing or just run around. Toys your child can pick up and move around will help improve their co-ordination and develop the muscles in their arms and hands. Involve your toddler in household tasks like unpacking shopping, tidying or sorting washing. Teach your child songs with actions and encourage them to dance to music. Watching TV or using a tablet for long periods \u2013 or being strapped into a buggy, car seat or highchair \u2013 isn't good for young children. If you need to make a long car journey, consider taking a break and getting your child out of their seat for a bit. See physical activity guidelines for children under five. It's good to join in with your child's active play when you can. Have fun showing them how to do new things like running and hopping. Being active together shows your child that activity is enjoyable. You're a role model for your child so stay active yourself and try to meet the physical activity guidelines for adults. There may be activities for parents and children at your local leisure centre or Sure Start Children's Centre. All babies and young children need to be active, including children with a long-term condition or disability, unless their health professionals give you different advice. Just like other children, they will enjoy being active and it will help their development. You may need to adapt some activities to suit your child. Scope has ideas for games all children can play, and the Contact a Family advice service offers information on caring for a disabled child. It can be exhausting keeping up with a toddler who is always on the go. It may help if you: keep to a daily routine \u2013 routine can help if your child is restless or difficult; it can also help you stay calm and cope with the strain dedicate time to your child \u2013 make sure there are times each day when you give them your full attention avoid difficult situations \u2013 for example, keep shopping trips short try to go out every day \u2013 go to a park, playground or other safe, open space where your child can run around and use up energy set small goals \u2013 help your child to sit still and concentrate for a very short time, perhaps on a book or new toy, then gradually build it up At times you may wonder if your non-stop toddler has ADHD.

They include: local anaesthetic epidural anaesthetic spinal anaesthetic nerve blocks  Page last reviewed: 08/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2018 ","Side effects":"General anaesthetics have some common side effects. Your anaesthetist should discuss these with you before your surgery. Most side effects occur immediately after your operation and don't last long. Possible side effects include: feeling sick and vomiting \u2013 this usually occurs immediately, although some people may continue to feel sick for up to a day shivering and feeling cold \u2013 this may last a few minutes or hours confusion and memory loss \u2013 this is more common in elderly people or those with existing memory problems; it's usually temporary, but occasionally can be longer lasting bladder problems \u2013 you may have difficulty passing urine dizziness \u2013 you will be given fluids to treat this bruising and soreness \u2013 this may develop in the area where you were injected or had a drip fitted; it usually heals without treatment sore throat \u2013 during your operation, a tube may be inserted either into your mouth or down your throat to help you breathe; afterwards, this can cause a sore throat damage to the mouth or teeth \u2013 a small proportion of people may have small cuts to their lips or tongue from the tube, and some may have damage to their teeth; you should tell your anaesthetist about any dental work you have had done ","Introduction ":"General anaesthesia is a state of controlled unconsciousness. During a general anaesthetic, medications are used to send you to sleep, so you're unaware of surgery and don't move or feel pain while it's carried out. General anaesthesia is essential for some surgical procedures where it may be safer or more comfortable for you to be unconscious. It's usually used for long operations or those that would otherwise be very painful. It's not clear exactly how it works, but it's known that all anaesthetics interrupt the passage of signals along the nerves. This means that any stimulation to the body doesn't get processed or recognised by the brain. ","How general anaesthetics are given":"Before having an operation, you'll meet a specialist doctor called an anaesthetist to discuss which anaesthetic is most suitable for you. Your anaesthetist will look at your medical history and will ask whether anyone in your family has had problems with anaesthesia. They'll also ask about your general health and lifestyle, including whether you: have any allergies smoke or drink alcohol are taking any other medication Your anaesthetist can answer any questions you have. Let them know if you're unsure about any part of the procedure or if you have any concerns. You should be given clear instructions to follow before the operation, including whether you can eat or drink anything in the hours leading up to it. Just before you have surgery, you'll usually be taken to a room where your anaesthetist will give you the general anaesthetic.  It will either be given as a: liquid that's injected into your veins through a cannula (a thin, plastic tube that feeds into a vein, usually on the back of your hand) gas that you breathe in through a mask The anaesthetic should take effect very quickly. You'll start feeling light-headed, before becoming unconscious within a minute or so. Your anaesthetist will stay with you throughout the procedure. They'll make sure you continue to receive the anaesthetic and that you stay in a controlled state of unconsciousness. They'll also give you painkilling medicine into your veins, so that you're comfortable when you wake up. After your operation, the anaesthetist will stop the anaesthetic and you'll gradually wake up. You'll usually be in a recovery room at first, before being transferred to a ward. Depending on your circumstances, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few hours to a few days after your operation. General anaesthetics can affect your memory, concentration and reflexes for a day or two, so it's important for a responsible adult to stay with you for at least 24 hours after your operation, if you're allowed to go home. You'll also be advised to avoid driving, drinking alcohol and signing any legal documents for 24-48 hours. ","Complications and risks":"A number of more serious complications are associated with general anaesthetics. These are rare, occurring in less than 1 in every 10,000 cases. Possible serious complications and risks include: a serious allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (anaphylaxis) an inherited reaction to the anaesthetic that causes breathing difficulties waking up during your operation \u2013 but this is rare, and the amount of anaesthetic given will be continuously monitored to help ensure this doesn't happen death \u2013 this is very rare, occurring in 1 in every 100,000 to 1 in every 200,000 cases Serious problems are more likely to occur if you're having major or emergency surgery, you have any other illnesses, you smoke, or you're overweight. Your anaesthetist will discuss the risks with you before your operation. You should try to stop smoking or drinking alcohol in the weeks before surgery, as doing so will reduce your risk of developing complications. You may also be advised to lose weight, and if you can you should increase your activity levels in the weeks before surgery, as this is likely to reduce your risk as well. In most cases, the benefits of being pain-free during an operation outweigh the risks.

It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma. A benign brain tumour is a growth in the brain that usually grows slowly over many years and doesn't spread to other parts of the body. Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance, which can cause problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness. They can sometimes be serious if they become very large, but most are picked up and treated before they reach this stage. Acoustic neuromas tend to affect adults aged 30-60 and usually have no obvious cause, although a small number of cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).

Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include: hearing loss, which usually only affects one ear tinnitus (hearing sounds that come from inside the body) vertigo (the sensation that you're moving or spinning) A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause: persistent headaches temporary blurred or double vision numbness, pain or weakness on one side of the face problems with limb co-ordination (ataxia) on one side of the body a hoarse voice or difficulty swallowing See your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you're worried could be caused by an acoustic neuroma. Acoustic neuromas can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as Ménière's disease. If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as: hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head a computerised tomography (CT) scan, which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health. The main options are: monitoring the tumour \u2013 small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and the treatments below are generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger brain surgery \u2013 surgery to remove the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger stereotactic radiosurgery \u2013 small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger All these options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or paralysis (an inability to move part of your face). Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks are. Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). However, it's rare for them to reach this stage. Many grow very slowly or not at all, and those that grow more quickly can be treated before they become too big. Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and/or drive. These problems may need additional treatment \u2013 read more about treating hearing loss and treating tinnitus. An acoustic neuroma can occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. You will probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment, to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back. ","The 100,000 Genomes Project":"If your doctor thinks there could be a genetic cause for your acoustic neuroma, you may be invited to take part in the 100,000 Genomes Project. Your DNA will be studied to find out more about the cause of your condition. The aim is to create a new personalised medicine service for the NHS. This should transform the way people are cared for. Find out if you might be able to take part. Page last reviewed: 11/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019 ","Information about you":"If you have an acoustic neuroma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

This could be due to domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse or female genital mutilation. From around 24 weeks, your antenatal appointments will usually become more frequent. However, if your pregnancy is uncomplicated and you are in good health, you may not be seen as often as someone who needs to be more closely monitored. Later visits are usually quite short. Your midwife or doctor will:  check your urine and blood pressure feel your abdomen (tummy) to check the baby's position measure your uterus (womb) to check your baby's growth listen to your baby's heartbeat if you want them to You can also ask questions or talk about anything that's worrying you. Talking about your feelings is as important as all the antenatal tests and examinations. You should be given information about: your birth plan  preparing for labour and birth how to tell if you're in active labour induction of labour if your baby is overdue (after your expected date of delivery)  the \"baby blues\" and postnatal depression feeding your baby vitamin K (which is given to prevent bleeding caused by vitamin K deficiency in your baby) screening tests for newborn babies looking after yourself and your new baby The NICE antenatal care guidelines (from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) give useful information on the timing of visits during pregnancy and a description of what will happen each time. At each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will check your baby's growth. To do this, they'll measure the distance from the top of your womb to your pubic bone. The measurement will be recorded in your notes. In the last weeks of pregnancy, you may also be asked to keep track of your baby's movements. If your baby's movements become less frequent, slow down or stop, contact your midwife or doctor immediately. You'll be offered an ultrasound scan if they have any concerns about how your baby is growing and developing. At your booking appointment, your midwife will enter your details in a record book and will add to them at each visit. These are your maternity notes, sometimes called handheld notes. You\u2019ll be asked to keep your maternity notes at home and to bring them along to all your antenatal appointments. Take your notes with you wherever you go in case you need medical attention while you're away from home. Always ask your maternity team to explain anything in your notes that you don't understand. Waiting times in clinics can vary, and having to wait a long time for an appointment can be particularly difficult if you have young children with you. Planning ahead can make your visits easier, so here are some suggestions:  Write a list of any questions you want to ask and take it with you. Make sure you get answers to your questions or the opportunity to discuss any worries. If your partner is free, they may be able to go with you. This can make them feel more involved in the pregnancy. In some clinics you can buy refreshments. If not, take a snack with you if you're likely to get hungry. Find out about your schedule of antenatal appointments and what to expect at each one. ","How often should my unborn baby move?":"When you first learn that you're pregnant, get in touch with a midwife or GP as soon as possible. Ideally this should be by 10 weeks of your pregnancy. Telling your GP and/or midwife promptly will help to make sure you receive maternity healthcare that takes into account all your health needs and preferences. Find maternity units in your area. You can read all the information on this page, or click on the links below to go straight to the relevant section: What is antenatal care? Starting your antenatal care How many appointments you'll have Your first visit and booking appointment Later visits Checking your baby's development and wellbeing Your maternity notes Antenatal care is the care you receive from healthcare professionals during your pregnancy. You'll be offered a series of appointments with a midwife, or sometimes with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and birth (an obstetrician). They will check that you and your baby are well, give you useful information to help you have a healthy pregnancy (including healthy eating and exercise advice) and answer any questions you may have. You will also be offered antenatal classes, including breastfeeding workshops. You need to book antenatal classes in advance, so ask your midwife about when you should book classes in your area. You can book an appointment with your GP or directly with your midwife as soon as you know that you're pregnant. Your GP surgery or a Children\u2019s Centre can put you in touch with your nearest midwifery service.  It's best to see them as early as possible to obtain the information you need to have a healthy pregnancy, and because some tests, such as screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia should be done before you're 10 weeks' pregnant. If you have special health needs, your midwife, GP or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care. This means they will all see you during your pregnancy. Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour. If you don't speak English, let your midwife know and arrangements will be made. If you're expecting your first child, you'll have up to 10 antenatal appointments. If you've had a baby before, you'll have around seven antenatal appointments. Under certain circumstances, for example if you develop a medical condition, you may have more. Early in your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will give you written information about how many appointments you're likely to have and when they'll happen. You should have a chance to discuss the schedule with them. If you can't keep an antenatal appointment, let the clinic or midwife know and make another appointment. Your appointments can take place at your home, in a Children's Centre, in your GP surgery or in hospital. You will usually go to the hospital for your scans. Your antenatal appointments should take place in a setting where you feel able to discuss sensitive issues that may affect you, such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, mental illness or drugs. To give you the best pregnancy care, your midwife will ask you many questions about your health, your family's health and your preferences. Your midwife will do some checks and tests, some of which will be done throughout your pregnancy. The results of these tests may affect your choices later in pregnancy, so it\u2019s important not to miss them. Your midwife will also ask about any other social care support you may have or need, such as support from social workers or family liaison officers. Your first visit with your midwife or GP is the appointment when you tell them that you're pregnant. At this first visit, you will be given information about:  folic acid and vitamin D supplements nutrition, diet and food hygiene lifestyle factors that may affect your health or the health of your baby, such as smoking, recreational drug use and drinking alcohol  antenatal screening tests, including screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia, infectious diseases and screening for Down's syndrome. You should be offered screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia before 10 weeks. This is so you and your partner can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby is at risk of inheriting one of these conditions. They will give you information on keeping healthy, and ask whether you have had any previous health or pregnancy issues, such as complications in pregnancy. It's important to tell your midwife or doctor if: you've had any complications or infections in a previous pregnancy or delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or premature birth  you're being treated for a chronic disease, such as diabetes or high blood pressure  you or anyone in your family have previously had a baby with an abnormality, such as spina bifida  there's a family history of an inherited disease, such as sickle cell or cystic fibrosis you know that you are a genetic carrier for an inherited condition such as sickle cell or thalassaemia. You should also tell the midwife if you know the baby's biological father is a genetic carrier for one of these conditions you have had fertility treatment and either a donor egg or donor sperm An important part of antenatal care is getting information that will help you to make informed choices about your pregnancy. Your midwife or doctor will give you information in writing or some other form that you can easily use and understand. They can provide you with information in an appropriate format if you:  have a physical, learning or sensory disability do not speak English Your next appointment should happen when you are 8-12 weeks pregnant. This is called the booking appointment. It will last for up to two hours, and could take place either at a hospital or in the community, for example in a clinic at a health centre, in a GP surgery or at home. You'll see a midwife and sometimes a doctor. You may also be offered an ultrasound scan. You will be given information about: how the baby develops during pregnancy (see the pregnancy development slideshow) nutrition and diet general exercise and pelvic floor exercises antenatal screening tests your antenatal care and antenatal classes breastfeeding workshops  maternity and paternity benefits  planning your labour and where to have your baby  The midwife or doctor will ask questions to build up a picture of you and your pregnancy. This is to make sure you're given the support you need, and so that any risks are spotted early. You will probably want to ask a lot of questions. It often helps to write down what you want to say in advance, as it\u2019s easy to forget once you're there. It\u2019s important to find out what you want to know and to talk about your own feelings and preferences. Several antenatal screening tests are performed on a sample of your blood which is usually taken at your booking appointment.  ","URL":"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/antenatal-midwife-care-pregnant.aspx#close"},"Title":"Your antenatal care"},"Artificial insemination":{"Introduction":{" ":"Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that involves directly inserting sperm into a woman's womb. Accessing IUI on the NHS Paying for IUI privately Fertility tests before IUI Timing your IUI treatment IUI using a partner's sperm IUI using donor sperm Your chances of success with IUI Are there any risks? See your GP if you are considering having IUI on the NHS. You may be offered IUI if: you're unable to have vaginal sex \u2013 for example, because of a physical disability or psychosexual problem you have a condition that means you need specific help to conceive, for example, if one of you has HIV and it's not safe to have unprotected sex you're in a same-sex relationship and haven't got pregnant after up to six cycles of IUI using donor sperm from a licensed fertility unit (the Stonewall website has more information about IUI for same-sex couples) Bear in mind that the waiting list for IUI treatment can be very long in some areas. The criteria you have to meet to be eligible for IUI can also vary. Check with your GP or local CCG to find out what the rules are where you live. IUI is also available from some private fertility clinics. The Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority (HFEA) has a fertility clinic finder. Costs range from about £800 to £1,300 for each cycle of IUI treatment. Before IUI is carried out, you and your partner's fertility will need to be assessed to find out why you are having difficulty conceiving and to see whether IUI is suitable for you. Read more about diagnosing infertility. For a woman to have IUI, her fallopian tubes (the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb) must be open and healthy. You and your partner won't usually be offered IUI if you have: unexplained infertility a low sperm count or poor\u2011quality sperm mild endometriosis This is because there is some evidence to suggest that it won't increase your chances of getting pregnant in these circumstances compared with natural attempts. You may be offered IUI in a natural (unstimulated) cycle or in a stimulated cycle. To increase your chances of success, a cycle of IUI should be carried out just after ovulation. Ovulation usually happens between 12 and 16 days after a woman has had their period, if you have a regular menstrual cycle. This can vary if you have an irregular menstrual cycle. You may be given an ovulation prediction kit (OPK) to help you work out the date of ovulation. An OPK device detects hormones released during ovulation in urine or saliva. Otherwise, blood tests may be used to find out when you are about to ovulate. ","Stimulated IUI":"Sometimes, fertility medicines are used to stimulate ovulation before IUI. In this case, vaginal ultrasound scans are used to track the development of your eggs. As soon as an egg is mature, you'll be given a hormone injection to stimulate its release. If a couple decides to have IUI using their own sperm, the man will be asked to provide a sperm sample at the fertility clinic by masturbating into a specimen cup. This usually happens on the same day that IUI treatment takes place. The sperm sample will be \"washed\" and filtered to produce a concentrated sample of healthy sperm. An instrument called a speculum is inserted into the woman's vagina to keep it open. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is then placed inside the vagina and guided into the womb. The sperm sample is then passed through the catheter and into the womb. This process is mostly painless, although some women experience mild cramping for a short while. The process usually takes no more than 10 minutes. You should be able to go home after a short rest. Frozen sperm from a donor can also be used for IUI, regardless of whether you are single or in a partnership, gay or straight. All licensed fertility clinics in the UK are required to screen donor sperm for infections and inherited diseases. Some infections take a while to show, so the sperm will be frozen for six months to allow time for infections, such as HIV, to be detected. The sperm is frozen whether it's from someone you know or from a registered, licensed sperm bank. Choosing to use donated sperm can be a difficult decision, and you should be offered counselling before you go ahead. Read more about using a sperm donor. This depends on lots of different things, including: the cause of infertility  the woman's age the man's sperm count and sperm quality (using fresh sperm leads to higher conception rates than using frozen sperm) whether or not fertility medicines are used to stimulate ovulation (this can increase your chances of success) There are many different factors involved, so it's best to talk to your fertility team about your individual chances of success. Some women have mild cramps similar to period pains, but otherwise the risks involved with IUI are minimal. If you take a fertility medicine to stimulate ovulation, there is a small risk of developing a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. There's also a chance that you will have more than one baby, which carries additional risks for both you and your babies.

This can lead to several serious conditions, including: strokes \u2013 where a blood clot restricts the flow of blood to your brain, causing brain cells to die and possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) \u2013 also called \"mini-strokes\", these have similar symptoms to a stroke, but the effects usually last less than 24 hours heart attacks \u2013 where a blood clot blocks a blood vessel supplying your heart, starving it of oxygen and causing chest pain and sometimes death deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 where a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins in your body, usually your legs, causing pain and swelling pulmonary embolism \u2013 where a blood clot blocks one of the blood vessels around the lungs, stopping the supply of blood to your lungs ","URL":"/conditions/Anticoagulant-medicines","Who should take anticoagulants?":"Your doctor may recommend anticoagulants to help prevent the above conditions if they feel you're at risk. This may be because you have: developed blood clots in the past recently had surgery that means you're unable to move around much while you recover, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement had an aortic valve replacement \u2013 as blood clots can form on the surface of the new heart valve atrial fibrillation \u2013 a type of irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can cause blood clots to form in the heart a condition where the blood has an increased tendency to form clots (thrombophilia), such as Factor V Leiden antiphospholipid syndrome \u2013 where the immune system attack fats and proteins in the blood vessels, causing the blood to clot Anticoagulants are also sometimes used to treat blood clots, such as DVT or a pulmonary embolism, by stopping the clot getting bigger while your body slowly reabsorbs it. How long you'll need to take anticoagulants for will depend on why they're needed. You might only need to take them for a short time after a hip or knee replacement, but treatment may be lifelong if you have a long-term condition that increases your risk of blood clots. Page last reviewed: 16/06/2015 Next review due: 28/02/2018 "},"Introduction":{"Types of anticoagulants":"The most commonly prescribed anticoagulant is warfarin. Newer types of anticoagulants are also available and are becoming increasingly common. These include: rivaroxaban (Xarelto)  dabigatran (Pradaxa)  apixaban (Eliquis) edoxaban (Lixiana) Warfarin and the newer alternatives are taken as tablets or capsules. There's also an anticoagulant called heparin that can be given by injection. ","Introduction ":"Anticoagulants are medicines that help prevent blood clots. They're given to people at a high risk of getting clots, to reduce their chances of developing serious conditions such as strokes and heart attacks. A blood clot is a seal created by the blood to stop bleeding from wounds. While they're useful in stopping bleeding, they can block blood vessels and stop blood flowing to organs such as the brain, heart or lungs if they form in the wrong place. Anticoagulants work by interrupting the process involved in the formation of blood clots. They're sometimes called \"blood-thinning\" medicines, although they don't actually make the blood thinner. Although they're used for similar purposes, anticoagulants are different to antiplatelet medicines, such as low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel. ","Things to consider when taking anticoagulants":"There are several things you need to be aware of when taking anticoagulant medicines. If you're going to have surgery or a test such as an endoscopy, make sure your doctor or surgeon is aware that you're taking anticoagulants, as you may have to stop taking them for a short time. Speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist before taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as some medications can affect how your anticoagulant works. If you're taking warfarin, you'll also need to avoid making significant changes to what you normally eat and drink, as this can affect your medication. Most anticoagulant medicines aren't suitable for pregnant women. Speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic if you become pregnant or are planning to try for a baby while taking anticoagulants. Read more about things to consider when taking anticoagulants. ","When anticoagulants are used":"If a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through a blood vessel, the affected part of the body will become starved of oxygen and will stop working properly. Depending on where the clot forms, this can lead to serious problems such as: strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (\"mini-strokes\") heart attacks deep vein thrombosis (DVT) pulmonary embolism Treatment with anticoagulants may be recommended if your doctor feels you're at an increased risk of developing one of these problems. This may be because you've had blood clots in the past or you've been diagnosed with a condition such as atrial fibrillation that can cause blood clots to form. You may also be prescribed an anticoagulant if you've recently had surgery, as the period of rest and inactivity you need during your recovery can increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Read more about when anticoagulants are used. ","How to take anticoagulants":"Your doctor or nurse should tell you how much of your anticoagulant medicine to take and when to take it.  Most people need to take their tablets or capsules once or twice a day with water or food. The length of time you need to keep taking your medicine for depends on why it's been prescribed. In many cases, treatment will be lifelong. If you're unsure how to take your medicine, or are worried that you missed a dose or have taken too much, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it or ask your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist what to do. You can also call NHS 111 for advice. Read more about anticoagulant doses. ","Side effects of anticoagulants":"Like all medicines, there's a risk of experiencing side effects while taking anticoagulants. The main side effect is that you can bleed too easily, which can cause problems such as: passing blood in your urine passing blood when you poo or having black poo severe bruising prolonged nosebleeds bleeding gums vomiting blood or coughing up blood heavy periods in women For most people, the benefits of taking anticoagulants will outweigh the risk of excessive bleeding.

This can cause birth defects or excessive bleeding from the placenta or foetus. It may sometimes be used in the second trimester, but should never be taken during the first trimester and should ideally be avoided in the third trimester as well. The newer anticoagulant medications apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) are also not recommended in pregnancy. If you're taking any of these medications, you should make sure you use contraception when having sex to avoid becoming pregnant. If you're on anticoagulants and find out you're pregnant or plan to start trying for a baby, speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic about stopping or changing your prescription. Injections of an anticoagulant called heparin can be given while you're pregnant if necessary. ","Things to consider when taking anticoagulants ":"If you're prescribed anticoagulants, always follow the instructions of your GP or other healthcare professional. Some of the main issues you'll need to consider while taking your medication are outlined below. ","Food and drink":"It's important to have a healthy, balanced diet that includes lots of fruit and vegetables if you're taking anticoagulants, but you should avoid making frequent changes to the amount of green vegetables you eat and cranberry juice you drink if you're taking warfarin. Cranberry juice and some green vegetables, such as broccoli, kale and spinach, contain a lot of vitamin K, which can reduce the effect of your medication. You can still include these in your diet while taking warfarin, as the clinic will adjust your dose accordingly, but it\u2019s important to be consistent in the amount you consume. You should also seek advice before taking supplements containing vitamin K. The effect of warfarin is also affected by alcohol. If you're taking warfarin, don't drink more than one or two alcoholic drinks a day and never binge drink.  These food and drink restrictions don't usually apply if you're taking apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, but you should check with your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist if you're not sure. Page last reviewed: 16/06/2015 Next review due: 28/02/2018 ","Having surgery":"If you're taking anticoagulants and you need to have surgery or any kind of invasive procedure, make sure that the healthcare professionals treating you are aware of your medication. This includes procedures used to diagnose other conditions, such as an endoscopy or cystoscopy. As anticoagulants reduce the ability of your blood to clot, there's a risk you could experience heavy bleeding if any kind of cut (incision) is made during a procedure. You may therefore be advised to stop taking your medication before surgery. If you're having a dental procedure, such as having a tooth removed, tell your dentist that you take anticoagulants. You may not need to stop taking your medication, but you might need to have a blood test before the procedure to make sure your blood clots at the right speed. Only stop taking your medication on the advice of your GP or another healthcare professional. ","Other medications and remedies":"If you're taking anticoagulants, you should speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist before taking any other medication, remedy or supplement. This includes prescription medicines, medicines bought over the counter without a prescription (such as aspirin), and any herbal remedies (such as St John's Wort). Some treatments can stop anticoagulants working or can increase the effect they have, which can be dangerous. Some of the medicines that can affect anticoagulants include certain: antibiotics  antidepressants corticosteroids (medications used to reduce inflammation) anticonvulsants (medications used to treat epilepsy) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen \u2013 take paracetamol instead if you need pain relief  For a full list of medicines that you should avoid, find your medicine on the anticoagulant medicines information page or check the leaflet that comes with it. ","Breastfeeding":"You can usually take warfarin while you're breastfeeding, but you should discuss this with your GP or midwife first. Heparin is also safe to take while you're breastfeeding. Apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban aren't recommended if you're breastfeeding because it's not clear if they're safe for the baby. If you're on anticoagulants and are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or midwife to find out if you need to change your prescription. ","Avoiding injury":"Taking anticoagulant medicines can make you more prone to bleeding if you are injured. Try to avoid minor injuries and cuts and grazes by: taking care when brushing your teeth and shaving \u2013 consider using a soft toothbrush and an electric razor using insect repellent to avoid insect bites or stings using protection when gardening, sewing or playing sports Your GP or anticoagulant clinic may advise you to avoid contact sports because of the risk of excessive bleeding. ","URL":"/conditions/Anticoagulant-medicines"},"Dosage":{"Missed or extra doses":"If you're taking warfarin and you miss one of your doses, you should skip the dose you missed and wait to take your next scheduled dose as normal. Don't take a double dose to make up for the one you missed. If you accidentally take a dose that was much higher than recommended, contact your anticoagulant clinic or GP for advice. If you're taking apixaban or dabigatran twice a day and you miss one of your doses, you should take it as soon as you remember if it's still more than six hours until your next scheduled dose. If it's less than six hours until your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take the next scheduled dose as normal. If you accidentally take a double dose, skip your next scheduled dose and take the following dose the next day as scheduled. If you're taking rivaroxaban once a day and you miss one of your doses, you should take it as soon as you remember if it's still more than 12 hours until your next scheduled dose. If it's less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take the next scheduled dose as normal. If you accidentally take a double dose, take your next dose the next day as scheduled. ","Monitoring your dose":"If you're taking warfarin, you will need regular blood tests to check how quickly your blood clots. This is measured using the international normalisation ratio (INR). Your INR will be regularly tested at your GP surgery or anticoagulant clinic to make sure your blood doesn't clot too slowly or too quickly. Your warfarin dose will be adjusted until your INR is in the correct range. Your INR may need to be tested every other day at first until you're on the right dose. Once your INR stabilises in the correct range, these tests will be needed less frequently. There are now home testing kits to monitor your INR. These mean you don't need to go to your GP surgery or anticoagulant clinic for the INR test. This kit may be useful for some people, but you'll need training to use it and you'll usually need to pay for one yourself. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you're considering using a home testing kit. If you're taking apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban, you won't need to have regular blood tests to monitor your INR. However, you should still have appointments every few months to check you're taking your medication correctly and to discuss whether you've experienced any side effects. Page last reviewed: 16/06/2015 Next review due: 28/02/2018 ","About your anticoagulant dose":"For most people, anticoagulant tablets or capsules should be taken at the same time once or twice a day. It's important to take your medicine as scheduled because the effect of some anticoagulants can start to wear off within a day. Warfarin, apixaban (Eliquis) and dabigatran (Pradaxa) should be taken with water. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is normally taken with food. Depending on your dose, you may need to take more than one tablet or capsule at a time. Warfarin tablets come in different colours (white, brown, blue and pink) to indicate their strength. You may need to take a combination of different coloured tablets to reach your total dose. Other anticoagulants come in different strengths and colours. Your doctor or nurse will explain how many tablets you need to take, when to take them, and what the different colours mean. ","URL":"/conditions/Anticoagulant-medicines","How to take anticoagulants ":"Your doctor or nurse should tell you how much of your anticoagulant medicine to take and when to take it.  If you're unsure how to take your medicine, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it or ask your anticoagulant clinic, GP or pharmacist what to do. You can also call NHS 111 for advice. "}},"Achalasia":{"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"Achalasia is a disorder of the gullet (oesophagus) where it loses the ability to move food along. The valve at the end of the gullet also fails to open and allow food to pass into your stomach. As a result, food gets stuck in your gullet and is often brought back up. A ring of muscle called the lower oesophageal (cardiac) sphincter keeps the opening from the gullet to the stomach shut tight to prevent acid reflux (acidic stomach content moving back up into the gullet). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow the food to pass into your stomach. In achalasia, this muscle does not relax properly and the end of your gullet becomes blocked with food. Achalasia is an uncommon condition that affects about 6,000 people in Britain. It is sometimes known as cardiospasm. ","Recovering from treatment":"There are a few things you can do after dilatation or surgery to reduce symptoms: chew your food well take your time eating drink plenty of fluids with your meals always eat food sitting upright use several pillows or raise the head of your bed so that you sleep fairly upright, which prevents stomach acid rising into your gullet through the weakened valve and causing heartburn If heartburn develops after treatment, consult your GP as medication may be needed to reduce the acid reflux. Sometimes your surgeon may suggest you take this routinely to prevent problems after surgery. Read about treatments for acid reflux. You should also see your GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight. It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment \u2013 drinking cold water often gives relief. ","How is it diagnosed?":"If your GP thinks you have achalasia, you will be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests performed. A barium swallow involves drinking a white liquid containing the chemical barium, which allows the gullet to be seen and videoed on an X-ray. In achalasia, the exit at the lower end of your gullet never opens properly, which causes a delay in barium passing into your stomach. An ordinary chest X-ray may show a wide gullet. A flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your gullet and stomach. Trapped food will be visible. The endoscope can be passed through the tight muscle at the bottom of your gullet and into your stomach to check there is no other disorder of the stomach. Read more about having an endoscopy. Manometry measures pressure waves in your gullet. A small plastic tube is passed into your gullet through your mouth or nose and the pressure at different points in your gullet is measured. In achalasia, there are usually weak or absent contractions of the gullet and sustained high pressure in the muscle at the lower end of the gullet. The high pressure means the muscle does not relax in response to swallowing, causing symptoms of achalasia. ","URL":"/conditions/achalasia","What are the symptoms?":"Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life and usually come on gradually. Most people with achalasia have dysphagia, a condition where they find it difficult and sometimes painful to swallow food. This tends to get worse over a couple of years. It may cause you to bring back up undigested food shortly after meals and some of the vomited food may have been held up in your gullet for some time. Bringing up undigested food can lead to choking and coughing fits, chest pain and heartburn. Occasionally, vomit may dribble out of your mouth and stain the pillow during the night. If it trickles down your windpipe, it can cause repeated chest infections and even pneumonia. You may experience gradual but significant weight loss. However, in some people achalasia causes no symptoms and is only discovered when a chest X-ray or other investigation is performed for another reason. ","What is the cause?":"Achalasia is caused by damage to and loss of the nerves in the gullet wall. The reason for this is unknown, although a viral infection earlier in life may be partly responsible. Achalasia may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs. One recent study found people with achalasia are significantly more likely to have an autoimmune condition such as Sjogren's syndrome, lupus or uveitis. Although achalasia can occur at any age, it is more common in middle-aged or older adults. There is no evidence to suggest that achalasia is an inherited illness. Women with achalasia can have a normal pregnancy and there's no reason why their children will not develop normally. ","How is it treated?":"The aim of treatment is to open the lower oesophageal sphincter muscle so food can pass into the stomach easily. The underlying disease cannot be cured but there are various ways to relieve symptoms which can improve swallowing and eating. The muscle at the lower end of your gullet may be temporarily relaxed by medication. Tablets such as nitrates or nifedipine can sometimes produce a brief improvement in swallowing but are not effective in all patients. They can be helpful while a more permanent treatment is planned. These tablets may cause headaches, but this usually improves with continued treatment. This is done under a sedative or general anaesthetic (where you are put to sleep). A balloon (about 3-4cm in diameter) is used to stretch and disrupt the muscle fibres of the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your gullet. This usually improves swallowing but may need to be performed several times or repeated after one or more years. Balloon dilatation does carry the risk of oesophageal rupture which may require emergency surgery. Botox causes relaxation of the muscle fibres. It can be injected painlessly into the lower oesophageal sphincter muscle through an endoscope. This is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but has to be repeated. Botox can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments. Under general anaesthetic the gullet is accessed through the abdomen (tummy) or, rarely, the chest. The muscle fibres of the lower oesophageal sphincter that fail to relax are divided. This usually leads to a permanent improvement in swallowing. The operation is now performed by keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) and only requires an overnight stay in hospital. ","Cancer risk":"If the gullet contains a large amount of food that does not pass into the stomach in the normal way, the risk of cancer of the oesophagus (gullet) is slightly increased. The increased risk is likely to be most significant in long-term untreated achalasia. It's therefore important to get appropriate treatment for achalasia straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you. According to Cancer Research UK, compared with the general population: men with achalasia have an eight to 16 times higher risk of oesophageal cancer women with achalasia have a 20 times higher risk of one particular type of oesophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma) However, cancer of the oesophagus is very uncommon and although your risk is slightly increased, it remains highly unlikely.

Treatment aims to prevent the further production of abnormal light chains while monitoring and treating any problems affecting your organs. This can give your body enough time to gradually clear the deposits before they build up again and can help prevent organ damage. In most cases, this will involve having chemotherapy to damage the abnormal bone marrow cells and inhibit production of the abnormal proteins. You will also need treatment for organ failure \u2013 for example, you may need diuretic medication to treat heart failure and you may need dialysis if you have kidney failure.  Some people with kidney failure may be suitable to receive a kidney transplant, although the underlying bone marrow disorder will need to be suppressed by chemotherapy to prevent build-up of amyloid in the new kidney. After chemotherapy, you will need regular check-ups every six to 12 months to look for signs of the condition returning (relapsing). If it does relapse at any stage, chemotherapy may need to be started again. ","Diagnosing AL amyloidosis":"Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis can be challenging, since the symptoms are often very general. The diagnosis can be confirmed by removing a biopsy (small tissue sample) from the affected part of the body, and examining this under a microscope in the laboratory, using special stains to check for amyloid proteins. How the tissue sample is removed will depend on which parts of the body are affected. In some people with suspected anyloidosis, a biopsy of tummy fat (taken using a needle) or a biopsy from the gut (taken during an endoscopy) may give a positive result. Further diagnostic tests are also available at the NHS National Amyloidosis Centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London. These include a type of scan called SAP scintigraphy, which involves being injected with a mildly radioactive version of blood protein before being scanned with a gamma camera. This protein coats any amyloid deposits in your body, which highlights most areas of the body affected by amyloid deposits. You may also have further tests to assess how the amyloid deposits have affected your individual organs. For example, an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound scan) may be carried out to check the condition of your heart. ","Introduction ":"Amyloidosis is a group of rare but serious conditions caused by deposits of abnormal protein, called amyloid, in tissues and organs throughout the body. Proteins begin as a string of amino acids that fold themselves into a three-dimensional shape. This 'protein folding' allows them to perform useful functions within our cells. Amyloid is a description of proteins which have folded abnormally and then collected together. In this form they do not break down as easily as normal proteins and can build up in tissues and organs. If this build-up causes the tissues or organs to stop working properly, the resulting conditions are called amyloidosis. The amyloid deposits occasionally only affect one part of the body (localised amyloidosis), but more often several different part of the body are affected (systemic amyloidosis), such as the heart, kidneys, liver, or nerves. Without treatment to address the underlying cause, the amyloid deposits can eventually lead to organ failure and death \u2013 sometimes within only a year or two. There are around 30 different proteins that can misfold and form amyloid, which is why there are many different types of amyloidosis. Overall, about 600 new cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed in the UK every year and most occur in older people. This page will focus on the most common type in the UK, called AL amyloidosis (previously known as primary amyloidosis). ","Outlook":"Before effective treatments for AL amyloidosis were discovered, the outlook for the condition was poor, with many people only living for a few months. With modern treatments, the outlook varies depending on the extent of the amyloid deposits, your age and general health, and how well you respond to treatment. Overall, many people with AL amyloidosis now survive for several years after they are diagnosed with the condition and increasing numbers of people are living for a decade or more. ","Signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis":"AL amyloidosis can affect any organ, and the symptoms depend on which organs are affected. Most often amyloid is deposited in the kidneys and may cause kidney failure. Symptoms of kidney failure can include fluid retention (oedema), tiredness, weakness and loss of appetite. Amyloid deposited in the heart can cause it to become enlarged and impair its ability to pump blood efficiently around the body. This may result in heart failure, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and oedema. Some of the other possible signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis include: feeling lightheaded or fainting, particularly after standing or sitting up numbness or a tingling feeling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy) frothy urine an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) chest pain (angina) in men, erectile dysfunction diarrhoea or constipation blood spots on the skin carpal tunnel syndrome \u2013 compression of the nerve in your wrist an enlarged tongue AL amyloidosis doesn\u2019t usually cause any problems with memory loss, thinking speed, language, understanding, or judgement. ","What causes AL amyloidosis?":"AL amyloidosis occurs when an abnormality in the plasma cells found in bone marrow (the spongy tissue at the centre of some bones) results in the excessive production of proteins called 'light chains'. Normally, light chains form part of antibodies (proteins that help protect the body from illness and infection), but in cases of AL amyloidosis, large numbers of misfolded light chains are produced and these clump together into thread-like fibres that the body cannot clear away easily. These fibres typically then gradually start to form deposits in the heart, kidneys, nerves, or liver. The abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow are usually benign (non-cancerous), but some cases of AL amyloidosis are linked to a type of bone marrow cancer called multiple myeloma. Unlike some other types of amyloidosis, AL amyloidosis is not inherited, so a person with the condition cannot pass it on to their children. ","Information about you":"If you have amyloidosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Don't try to make the person vomit because they could choke on it. To prevent choking, turn them on to their side and put a cushion under their head. If a person loses consciousness, don't leave them to \"sleep it off\". Levels of alcohol in the blood can continue rising for 30-40 minutes after the last drink, and symptoms can worsen. Page last reviewed: 28/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Long-term effects of alcohol misuse":"Drinking large amounts of alcohol for many years will take its toll on many of the body's organs and may cause organ damage. Organs known to be damaged by long-term alcohol misuse include the brain and nervous system, heart, liver and pancreas. Heavy drinking can also increase your blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, both of which are major risk factors for heart attacks and strokes. Long-term alcohol misuse can weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to serious infections. It can also weaken your bones, placing you at greater risk of fracturing or breaking them. There are many long-term health risks associated with alcohol misuse. They include: high blood pressure stroke pancreatitis liver disease  liver cancer       mouth cancer head and neck cancer breast cancer bowel cancer   depression dementia  sexual problems, such as impotence or premature ejaculation    infertility  As well as having a significant impact on your health, alcohol misuse can also have long-term social implications. For example, it can lead to: family break-up and divorce domestic abuse unemployment homelessness financial problems ","Kindling":"Kindling is a problem that can occur following a number of episodes of withdrawal from alcohol. The severity of a person's withdrawal symptoms may get worse each time they stop drinking, and can cause symptoms such as tremors, agitation and convulsions (seizures). Alcohol has a suppressing effect on the brain and central nervous system. Research has shown that when alcohol is removed from the body, it activates brain and nerve cells, resulting in excessive excitability (hyperexcitability). This can lead to behavioural symptoms such as seizures. With each alcohol withdrawal episode, the brain and nervous system becomes more sensitised and the resulting side effects become more pronounced. This kindling effect can also occur after chemical stimulus to the brain or body, such as anti-convulsant medication. This means a person's alcohol withdrawal programme needs to be carefully planned, with close monitoring of its effects. Read more about kindling in alcohol withdrawal (PDF, 163kb). ","Short-term effects of alcohol consumption":"The short-term effects of alcohol consumption are outlined below. This information is based on the assumption that you have a normal tolerance to alcohol. Dependent drinkers with a higher tolerance to alcohol can often drink much more without experiencing any noticeable effects. After drinking 1-2 units of alcohol, your heart rate speeds up and your blood vessels expand, giving you the warm, sociable and talkative feeling associated with moderate drinking. After drinking 4-6 units of alcohol, your brain and nervous system starts to be affected. It begins to affect the part of your brain associated with judgement and decision making, causing you to be more reckless and uninhibited. The alcohol also impairs the cells in your nervous system, making you feel light-headed and adversely affecting your reaction time and co-ordination. After drinking 8-9 units of alcohol, your reaction times will be much slower, your speech will begin to slur and your vision will begin to lose focus. Your liver, which filters alcohol out of your body, will be unable to remove all of the alcohol overnight, so it's likely you'll wake with a hangover. After drinking 10-12 units of alcohol, your co-ordination will be highly impaired, placing you at serious risk of having an accident. The high level of alcohol has a depressant effect on both your mind and body, which makes you drowsy. This amount of alcohol will begin to reach toxic (poisonous) levels. Your body attempts to quickly pass out the alcohol in your urine. This will leave you feeling badly dehydrated in the morning, which may cause a severe headache. The excess amount of alcohol in your system can also upset your digestion, leading to symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and indigestion. If you drink more than 12 units of alcohol, you're at considerable risk of developing alcohol poisoning, particularly if you're drinking many units over a short period of time. It usually takes the liver about an hour to remove one unit of alcohol from the body. Alcohol poisoning occurs when excessive amounts of alcohol start to interfere with the body's automatic functions, such as: breathing heart rate gag reflex, which prevents you choking Alcohol poisoning can cause a person to fall into a coma and could lead to their death. Some of the other risks associated with alcohol misuse include: accidents and injury \u2013 more than 1 in 10 visits to accident and emergency (A&E) departments are because of alcohol-related illnesses violence and antisocial behaviour \u2013 each year in England more than 1.2 million violent incidents are linked to alcohol misuse unsafe sex \u2013 this can lead to unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) loss of personal possessions \u2013 many people lose personal possessions, such as their wallet or mobile phone, when they're drunk unplanned time off work or college \u2013 this could put your job or education at risk ","URL":"/conditions/Alcohol-misuse","Risks of alcohol misuse ":"Alcohol is a powerful chemical that can have a wide range of adverse effects on almost every part of your body, including your brain, bones and heart. Alcohol and its associated risks can have both short-term and long-term effects. "},"Treatment":{"Treating alcohol misuse ":"The treatment options for alcohol misuse depend on the extent of your drinking and whether you're trying to drink less (moderation) or give up drinking completely (abstinence). This page covers: brief intervention moderation vs abstinence detox and withdrawal symptoms medication for alcohol dependency therapy for alcohol dependency ","Moderation vs abstinence":"Moderation or abstinence are treatment options if you're: regularly drinking more than the lower-risk daily levels of alcohol \u2013 14 units a week experiencing health problems directly related to alcohol unable to function without alcohol (alcohol dependency) Cutting alcohol out completely will have a greater health benefit. However, moderation is often a more realistic goal, or at least a first step on the way to abstinence. Ultimately, the choice is yours, but there are circumstances where abstinence is strongly recommended, including if you: have liver damage, such as liver disease or cirrhosis have other medical problems, such as heart disease, that can be made worse by drinking are taking medication that can react badly with alcohol, such as antipsychotics are pregnant or planning to become pregnant Abstinence may also be recommended if you've previously been unsuccessful with moderation. If you choose moderation, you'll probably be asked to attend further counselling sessions so your progress can be assessed, and further treatment and advice can be provided if needed. You may also have regular blood tests so the health of your liver can be carefully monitored. ","Detox and withdrawal symptoms":"If you're dependent on alcohol to function, it's recommended you seek medical advice to manage your withdrawal. Some people may be prescribed medication to help achieve abstinence. You may also choose to attend self-help groups, receive extended counselling, or use a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). How and where you attempt detoxification will be determined by your level of alcohol dependency. In mild cases, you should be able to detox at home without the use of medication as your withdrawal symptoms should also be mild. If your consumption of alcohol is high (more than 20 units a day) or you've previously experienced withdrawal symptoms, you may also be able to detox at home with medication to help ease withdrawal symptoms. A tranquiliser called chlordiazepoxide is usually used for this purpose. If your dependency is severe, you may need to go to a hospital or clinic to detox. This is because the withdrawal symptoms will also be severe and are likely to need specialist treatment. Your withdrawal symptoms will be at their worst for the first 48 hours. They should gradually start to improve as your body begins to adjust to being without alcohol. This usually takes three to seven days from the time of your last drink. You'll also find your sleep is disturbed. You may wake up several times during the night or have problems getting to sleep. This is to be expected, and your sleep patterns should return to normal within a month. During detox, make sure you drink plenty of fluids (about three litres a day). However, avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated drinks, including tea and coffee, because they can make your sleep problems worse and cause feelings of anxiety. Water, squash or fruit juice are better choices. Try to eat regular meals, even if you're not feeling hungry. Your appetite will return gradually. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you're taking medication to help ease your withdrawal symptoms. You need to tell the DVLA if you have an alcohol problem \u2013 failure to do so could result in a fine of up to £1,000. It's likely the medication will make you feel drowsy. Only take your medication as directed. Detox can be a stressful time. Ways you can try to relieve stress include reading, listening to music, going for a walk, and taking a bath. Read more about stress management. If you're detoxing at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or another healthcare professional. This might be at home, your GP practice, or a specialist NHS service. You'll also be given the relevant contact details for other support services should you need additional support. Withdrawal from alcohol is an important first step to overcoming your alcohol-related problems. However, withdrawal isn't an effective treatment by itself. You'll need further treatment and support to help you in the long term. ","Drinking diary":"If you're aiming to moderate your drinking, you may be asked to keep a \"drinking diary\". On a daily basis, make a note of: all the alcoholic drinks you've had what time you had them where you were how many units you drank \u2013 you can use the Alcohol Concern unit calculator to work this out This will give you a good idea of how much alcohol you're drinking, the situations in which you drink, and how you could start to cut down. Page last reviewed: 28/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Therapy for alcohol dependency":"Many people who have alcohol dependency problems find it useful to attend self-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). One of the main beliefs behind AA is that alcoholic dependence is a long-term, progressive illness and total abstinence is the only solution. The treatment plan promoted by AA is based on a 12-step programme designed to help you overcome your addiction. The steps include admitting you're powerless over alcohol and your life has become unmanageable, admitting you've acted wrongly and, where possible, making amends with people you've harmed. Read more about the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and alcohol support. Twelve-step facilitation therapy is based on the programme devised by AA. The difference is you work through the stages on a one-to-one basis with a counsellor, rather than in a group. The therapy may be your preferred treatment option if you feel uneasy or unwilling to discuss your problems in a group setting. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that uses a problem-solving approach to alcohol dependence. The approach involves identifying unhelpful, unrealistic thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing towards your alcohol dependence, such as: \"I can't relax without alcohol.\" \"My friends would find me boring if I was sober.\" \"Just drinking one pint can't hurt.\" Once these thoughts and beliefs are identified, you'll be encouraged to base your behaviour on more realistic and helpful thoughts, such as: \"Lots of people have a good time without alcohol, and I can be one of them.\" \"My friends like me for my personality, not for my drinking.\"  \"I know I can't stop drinking once I start.\" CBT also helps you identify triggers that can cause you to drink, such as: stress social anxiety being in \"high-risk\" environments, such as pubs, clubs and restaurants Your CBT therapist will teach you how to avoid certain triggers and cope effectively with those that are unavoidable. Alcohol dependence doesn't just impact on an individual \u2013 it can also affect a whole family. Family therapy provides family members with the opportunity to: learn about the nature of alcohol dependence support the member of the family who is trying to abstain from alcohol Support is also available for family members in their own right. Living with someone who misuses alcohol can be stressful, so receiving support can often be very helpful. There are a number of specialist alcohol services that provide help and support for the relatives and friends of people with a dependence on alcohol. For example, Al-Anon is an organisation affiliated with AA that provides relatives and friends with help and support. Its confidential helpline number is 020 7403 0888 (10am to 10pm, 365 days a year). Read more about the different types of talking therapies. ","Brief intervention":"If you are worried about your drinking or have had an alcohol-related accident or injury, you may be offered a short counselling session known as a brief intervention. A brief intervention lasts about 5 to 10 minutes, and covers risks associated with your pattern of drinking, advice about reducing the amount you drink, alcohol support networks available to you, and any emotional issues around your drinking. Keeping a \"drinking diary\" may be recommended so you can record how many units of alcohol you drink a week. You may also be given tips about social drinking, such as alternating soft drinks with alcoholic drinks when you're out with friends. ","URL":"/conditions/Alcohol-misuse","Medication for alcohol dependency":"A number of medications are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to treat alcohol misuse. These include: acamprosate disulfiram naltrexone nalmefene These medications are discussed in more detail below. Acamprosate (brand name Campral) is used to help prevent a relapse in people who have successfully achieved abstinence from alcohol. It's usually used in combination with counselling to reduce alcohol craving. Acamprosate works by affecting levels of a chemical in the brain called gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). GABA is thought to be partly responsible for inducing a craving for alcohol. If you're prescribed acamprosate, the course usually starts as soon as you begin withdrawal from alcohol and can last for up to six months. Disulfiram (brand name Antabuse) can be used if you're trying to achieve abstinence but are concerned you may relapse, or if you've had previous relapses. Disulfiram works by deterring you from drinking by causing unpleasant physical reactions if you drink alcohol. These can include: nausea chest pain vomiting dizziness In addition to alcoholic drinks, it's important to avoid all sources of alcohol as they could also induce an unpleasant reaction. Products that may contain alcohol include: aftershave mouthwash some types of vinegar perfume You should also try to avoid substances that give off alcoholic fumes, such as paint thinners and solvents. You'll continue to experience unpleasant reactions if you come into contact with alcohol for a week after you finish taking disulfiram, so it's important to maintain your abstinence during this time. When taking disulfiram, you'll be seen by your healthcare team about once every two weeks for the first two months, and then every month for the following four months. Naltrexone can be used to prevent a relapse or limit the amount of alcohol someone drinks.  It works by blocking opioid receptors in the body, stopping the effects of alcohol. It's usually used in combination with other medicine or counselling. If naltrexone is recommended, you should be made aware it also stops painkillers that contain opioids working, including morphine and codeine. If you feel unwell while taking naltrexone, stop taking it immediately and seek advice from your GP or care team. A course of naltrexone can last up to six months, although it may sometimes be longer. Before being prescribed any of these medications, you'll have a full medical assessment, including blood tests. Nalmefene (brand name Selincro) may be used to prevent a relapse or limit the amount of alcohol someone drinks. It works by blocking opioid receptors in the brain, which reduces cravings for alcohol. Nalmefene may be recommended as a possible treatment for alcohol dependence if you've had an initial assessment and: you're still drinking more than 7.5 units a day (for men) or more than 5 units a day (for women) you don't have any physical withdrawal symptoms you don't need to stop drinking immediately or achieve total abstinence Nalmefene should only be taken if you're receiving support to help you reduce your alcohol intake and continue treatment. "},"Introduction":{"Am I drinking too much alcohol?":"You could be misusing alcohol if: you feel you should cut down on your drinking other people have been criticising your drinking you feel guilty or bad about your drinking you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if: they regularly exceed the lower-risk daily limit for alcohol they're sometimes unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking they fail to do what was expected of them as a result of their drinking \u2013 for example, missing an appointment or work because of being drunk or hungover ","Lower-risk limits":"To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends: not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. ","Introduction ":"Alcohol misuse means drinking excessively \u2013 more than the lower-risk limits of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption is measured in units. A unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about: half a pint of normal-strength lager a single measure (25ml) of spirits A small glass (125ml) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol. ","Alcohol and pregnancy":"The Department of Health recommends pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, and the risk increases the more you drink. The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep the risk to your baby to a minimum. If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over three days or more. Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm.   Page last reviewed: 28/11/2015 Next review due: 01/11/2018 ","Getting help":"If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to visit your GP.

Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including: heart disease stroke liver disease liver cancer and bowel cancer mouth cancer  pancreatitis  As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness. If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this.  Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people. A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: hand tremors \u2013 \"the shakes\" sweating seeing things that aren't real (visual hallucinations) depression anxiety difficulty sleeping (insomnia) This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Treatment options include: counselling \u2013 including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication detoxification \u2013 this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms There are two main types of medicines to help people stop drinking. The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms, and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium). The second is a medication to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medications used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone. These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months. Read more about the treatment options for alcohol misuse.

See treatments to help you stop smoking and stop smoking advice for more information. "},"Treatment":{"Emergency treatment":"If you require emergency treatment because of a ruptured brain aneurysm, you'll initially be given a medication called nimodipine to reduce the risk of the blood supply to the brain becoming severely disrupted (cerebral ischaemia). Either coiling or clipping can then be used to repair the ruptured brain aneurysm. The technique used will usually be determined by the expertise and experience of the surgeons available. In such emergency cases, the differences between the techniques are less important because things like your recovery time and hospital stay depend more on the severity of the rupture than the type of surgery carried out. Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","Assessing your risk":"If you're diagnosed with an unruptured brain aneurysm, a risk assessment will be carried out to assess whether surgery is necessary. The assessment process is usually based on the following factors: your age \u2013 research has found the risks associated with surgery in older adults often outweigh the potential benefits (extending natural lifespan) the size of the aneurysm \u2013 aneurysms larger than 7mm often require surgical treatment, as do aneurysms larger than 3mm in cases where there are other risk factors the location of the aneurysm \u2013 brain aneurysms located on larger blood vessels have a higher risk of rupture family history \u2013 brain aneurysms are considered to have a higher risk of rupturing if you have a history of ruptured brain aneurysm in your family underlying health conditions \u2013 some health conditions increase the risk of a rupture, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or poorly controlled high blood pressure After these factors have been taken into consideration, your surgical team should be able to tell you whether the benefits of surgery outweigh the potential risks in your case. ","Surgery and procedures":"If preventative treatment is recommended, the two main techniques used are called neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. Both techniques help prevent ruptures by stopping blood flowing into the aneurysm. Neurosurgical clipping is carried out under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep throughout the operation. A cut is made in your scalp or sometimes just above your eyebrow, and a small flap of bone is removed so the surgeon can access your brain. When the aneurysm is located, the neurosurgeon will seal it shut using a tiny metal clip that stays permanently clamped on the aneurysm. After the bone flap has been replaced, the scalp is stitched together. Over time, the blood vessel lining will heal along the line where the clip is placed, permanently sealing the aneurysm and preventing it growing or rupturing in the future. Clipping the artery the aneurysm is formed on \u2013 as opposed to clipping the aneurysm itself \u2013 is rarely necessary. This is usually only carried out if the aneurysm is particularly large or complex. When this is necessary, it's often combined with a procedure called a bypass. This is where the bloodflow is diverted around the clamped area using a blood vessel removed from another place in the body, usually the leg. Endovascular coiling is also usually carried out under general anaesthetic. The procedure involves inserting a thin tube called a catheter into an artery in your leg or groin. The tube is guided through the network of blood vessels, up into your head and finally into the aneurysm. Tiny platinum coils are then passed through the tube into the aneurysm. Once the aneurysm is full of coils, blood cannot enter it. This means the aneurysm is sealed off from the main artery, which prevents it growing or rupturing. ","Active observation":"If the risk of rupture is considered low, a policy of active observation is normally recommended. This means you won't receive immediate surgery, but you'll be given regular check-ups so your aneurysm can be carefully monitored. You may also be given medication to lower your blood pressure. Your doctor will discuss lifestyle changes that can help lower the risk of a rupture, such as losing weight and reducing the amount of fat in your diet. ","Coiling versus clipping":"Whether clipping or coiling is used often depends on the size, location and shape of the aneurysm. Talk to your healthcare team about your treatment options. If it's possible to have either procedure, you should discuss the risks and benefits of both procedures. Coiling has generally been shown to have a lower risk of complications than clipping in the short term, such as seizures, although the benefits in the long term are not certain. With coiling, there's also a small chance you'll need to have the procedure more than once to reduce your chances of the aneurysm rupturing. About one in five people who have the coiling procedure need further treatment. However, as coiling is a less invasive procedure, you can usually leave hospital sooner after the operation. After clipping, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for around four to six days, whereas you can usually go home one or two days after coiling. The time it takes to fully recover is also typically shorter with coiling. Many people make a recovery within a few weeks of coiling, whereas recovering from clipping may take longer. ","URL":"/conditions/Aneurysm","Treating a brain aneurysm ":"Brain aneurysms can be treated using surgery if they've burst (ruptured) or there's a risk they will. Preventative surgery is usually only recommended if there's a high risk of a rupture. This is because surgery has its own risk of potentially serious complications, such as brain damage or stroke. "},"Introduction":{"Introduction ":"An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, usually where it branches.              As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes a small area to bulge outwards like a balloon. Aneurysms can develop in any blood vessel in the body, but the two most common places are: the abdominal aorta \u2013 the artery that transports blood away from the heart to the rest of the body the brain This topic is about brain aneurysms. There's a separate topic about abdominal aortic aneurysm. ","Why brain aneurysms develop":"Exactly what causes the wall of affected blood vessels to weaken is still unclear, although risk factors have been identified, including:  smoking high blood pressure a family history of brain aneurysms In some cases, an aneurysm may develop because there was a weakness in the walls of the blood vessels at birth. Read more about the causes of brain aneurysms. ","About brain aneurysms":"The medical term for an aneurysm that develops inside the brain is an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they burst (rupture). This leads to an extremely serious condition known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, where bleeding caused by the ruptured aneurysm can cause extensive brain damage and symptoms such as: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 it's been described as a \"thunderclap headache\", similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before stiff neck sickness and vomiting pain on looking at light About three in five people who have a subarachnoid haemorrhage die within two weeks. Half of those who survive are left with severe brain damage and disability. Read more about the symptoms of a brain aneurysm. A ruptured brain aneurysm is a medical emergency. If you suspect someone has had a brain haemorrhage, which could be caused by a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. ","Preventing brain aneurysms":"The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid activities that could damage your blood vessels, such as: smoking eating a high-fat diet not controlling high blood pressure being overweight or obese Read more about preventing aneurysms. Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","Who is affected?":"It's difficult to estimate exactly how many people are affected by brain aneurysms because they usually cause no symptoms and pass undetected. Some experts believe it could be as high as 1 in 20 people, while others think the figure is much lower at around 1 in 100 people. The number of aneurysms that actually rupture is much smaller. Only around 1 in 12,500 people have a ruptured brain aneurysm in England each year. Brain aneurysms can develop in anyone at any age, but are more common in people over the age of 40. Women tend to be affected more commonly than men. ","URL":"/conditions/Aneurysm","How brain aneurysms are treated":"If a brain aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in future. Most aneurysms won't rupture, so treatment is only carried out if the risk of a rupture is particularly high. Factors that affect whether treatment is recommended include your age, the size and position of the aneurysm, your family medical history, and any other health conditions you have. If treatment is recommended, this usually involves either filling the aneurysm with tiny metal coils or an open operation to seal it shut with a tiny metal clip. If your risk of a rupture is low, you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your aneurysm. You may also be given medication to reduce your blood pressure and advice about ways you can reduce your chances of a rupture, such as stopping smoking if you smoke. The same techniques used to prevent ruptures are also used to treat brain aneurysms that have already ruptured. Read more about diagnosing brain aneurysms and treating brain aneurysms. "},"Causes":{"Causes of a brain aneurysm ":"Brain aneurysms are caused by a weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. There are several reasons why this may happen, although an exact cause isn't always clear. The brain requires a large supply of blood delivered via four main blood vessels that run up the neck and into the brain. These blood vessels divide into smaller and smaller vessels in the same way the trunk of a tree divides into branches and twigs. Most aneurysms develop at the points where the blood vessels divide and branch off, as these areas are often weaker. ","Increased risk":"There are a number of things that can increase your risk of developing a brain aneurysm. These are discussed below. Smoking tobacco can significantly increase your risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Studies have shown the majority of people diagnosed with a brain aneurysm smoked, or had done so in the past. The risk is particularly high in people with a family history of brain aneurysm. Exactly why smoking increases the risk of brain aneurysms is unclear. It may be that the harmful substances in tobacco smoke damage the walls of your blood vessels. High blood pressure can place increased pressure on the walls of the blood vessels inside the brain, increasing your chances of developing an aneurysm. You're more likely to develop high blood pressure if you: are overweight have a relative with high blood pressure are of African or Caribbean descent eat a lot of salt don't eat enough fruit and vegetables don't do enough exercise drink a lot of coffee or other caffeine-based drinks drink a lot of alcohol are aged over 65 Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, with a history of a brain aneurysm means you're more likely to develop one than someone with no family history of the condition. However, the increased risk is still small \u2013 only around 1 in 50 people with a family history of a ruptured brain aneurysm have a rupture themselves. Your risk of developing a brain aneurysm increases as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over the age of 40. This may be because the walls of the blood vessels are weakened over time by the constant pressure of blood flowing through them. Women are more likely to develop a brain aneurysm than men. This may be because levels of a hormone called oestrogen lower significantly after the menopause. Oestrogen is thought to help maintain the elasticity of the blood vessels. In some cases, brain aneurysms are caused by weaknesses in the blood vessels present from birth. A brain aneurysm can develop after a severe brain injury if the blood vessels in the brain are damaged, although this is very rare. Cocaine abuse is considered to be another risk factor for brain aneurysms. Cocaine can inflame the walls of the blood vessels and raise your blood pressure. The combination of these two factors increases your risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic condition that causes multiple cysts to develop on the kidneys. Cysts are small sacs filled with fluid. Around 1 in every 1,000 people is born with ADPKD. Of these people, around 1 in 20 develop an aneurysm in the brain. Your risk of developing a brain aneurysm can be higher if you have a condition that affects your body tissues, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan syndrome. This is because these conditions can sometimes cause weaknesses in the walls of your blood vessels. People with coarctation of the aorta are also at an increased risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Coarctation of the aorta is the term used to describe narrowing of the main artery in the body (the aorta), which is present from birth (congenital). It is a common type of congenital heart disease.

This is because researchers have calculated routine screening would do little to prevent deaths, but would place a significant drain on NHS resources. Screening is only recommended for people thought to have a significant risk of having a brain aneurysm that could rupture at some point in future. This would usually only apply to you if you had two or more first-degree relatives (father, mother, sister or brother) who had experienced a subarachnoid haemorrhage. If this applies to you, contact your GP. They'll be able to refer you to a specialist clinic for further assessment. Discovering you have an aneurysm unsuitable for surgical treatment can cause worry and distress, even though the risk of it rupturing is small. Some people have reported regret at getting screened. There are no right or wrong answers, but it's important you discuss the potential implications of screening with the staff at the clinic. Screening may also be recommended if you have a condition that increases your chances of developing a brain aneurysm, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Page last reviewed: 14/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018 ","Planning treatment":"If the results of scans or a lumbar puncture suggest you've either had a brain haemorrhage or have an unruptured brain aneurysm, a further test called an angiogram or arteriogram may be carried out to help plan treatment. An angiogram or arteriogram involves inserting a needle, usually in the groin, through which a narrow tube called a catheter can be guided into one of your blood vessels. Local anaesthetic is used where the needle is inserted, so you won't feel any pain. Using a series of X-rays displayed on a monitor, the catheter is guided into the blood vessels in the neck that supply the brain with blood. Once in place, special dye is injected into the arteries of the brain through the catheter. This dye casts a shadow on an X-ray, so the outline of the blood vessels can be seen and an aneurysm can be recognised if one is present. ","Diagnosing a brain aneurysm ":"A brain aneurysm is usually diagnosed using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and angiography (MRA), or a computerised tomography (CT) scan and angiography (CTA). An MRI scan is usually used to look for aneurysms in the brain that haven't ruptured. This type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of your brain. A CT scan is usually preferred if it's thought the aneurysm has ruptured and there's bleeding on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage). This type of scan takes a series of X-rays, which are then assembled by a computer into a detailed three-dimensional image. In some cases, a ruptured aneurysm is not picked up by a CT scan. If a CT scan is negative but your symptoms strongly suggest you have a ruptured aneurysm, a test called a lumbar puncture will usually be carried out. A lumbar puncture is a procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to remove a sample of the fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) that surrounds and supports the brain and spinal cord. This fluid can be analysed for signs of bleeding. ","URL":"/conditions/Aneurysm"},"Symptoms":{"Symptoms of a brain aneurysm ":"A brain aneurysm rarely causes any symptoms unless it bursts (ruptures).
